<p class="noi">sang “Poke” Endicott, as he pulled a nice new
pair of fawn-hued football pants from his trunk
and reverently strove to smooth the creases
from them. “Aren’t those some pants, Gil?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>His room-mate turned from the window as the
“mole-skins” were held up for inspection.</p>

<p>“Rather! You must have spent a year’s allowance
on those, Poke.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” Poke folded them carefully and
then tossed them in the general direction of the
closet. “I’d hate to tell you, Gil, what they
stood me. But they’re good for ten years; anyhow,
that’s what the tailor man said. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
trousers, Gil, will descend from generation to
generation, down through the ages, like—like—”</p>

<p>“A mortgage,” suggested Gil Benton, helpfully,
as he turned again to the view of autumn
landscape framed by the open casement. Just
under the window, beyond the graveled path, the
smooth turf descended gently to the rim of the
little river which curved placidly along below
the school buildings barely a stone’s throw
away. (Joe Cosgrove, baseball captain, had
once engaged, on a wager, to place a baseball
across it from the steps of Academy Hall, and
had succeeded at the third attempt. As Academy
stands farthest from the stream of any of
the buildings, Joe’s throw was something of a
feat, and many a perfectly good baseball had
been sacrificed since by ambitious youths set on
duplicating his performance.) The Academy
side of the river was clear of vegetation, but
along the farther bank graceful weeping willows
dipped their trailing branches in the water
and threw cool green shadows across the surface.
Beyond, the willows gave place to alders
and swamp-oaks and basswood, and then, as the
ground rose to the rolling hills, maples, already
showing the first light frosts, clustered thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Here and there the white trunks of paper-birches
showed against the hillside.</p>

<p>Gil—his full name was Gilbert, but no one
ever called him that—viewed the familiar scene
with eager pleasure and satisfaction. To-morrow
began his third year at Crofton Academy,
and he had grown very fond of the school; how
fond he had scarcely realized until this minute.
To the left, a quarter of a mile away, the old
covered bridge was in sight, its central pier
emerging from a wilderness of bush on Bridge
Island. To his right, a little distance down-stream,
lay Biscuit Island, a tiny round mound
of moss-covered rock with here and there a
patch of grass, and, in the middle, a group of
four white birches asway in the westerly breeze.
Opposite the island was the brown-stained boat-house
and the long float, the latter as yet empty
of the canoes and skiffs and tubs that would
later gather there. By bending forward a little,
Gil could catch a glimpse of a corner of the
athletic field and the roofed portico of Apthorpe
Gymnasium, the last of the buildings that
formed a crescent along the curve of the river.</p>

<p>He smiled companionably at the blue and
green world, sighed once—why, he couldn’t
have told you—and breathed in a lungful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the warm, scented air. It was good to be back
again; awfully good! He wondered—</p>

<p>Footsteps crunched the gravel beneath the
window, and Gil leaned out. Then he turned
and called to his chum:</p>

<p>“Say, Poke, come and see ‘Brownie.’ He’s
got a suit of ‘ice-cream’ clothes on, and a
Panama hat! Me, oh, my! Who’d ever think
Brownie could be so frivolous?”</p>

<p>Poke stumbled over a pile of clothing and hurried
across to the casement, leaning out beside
Gil. Almost directly below was a tall man of
thirty-odd years, attired modishly in light home-spun.
When, in answer to Poke’s “Hello, Mr.
Brown!” he looked up at the window, his face
was seen to carry a rich coating of tan from
which his very light blue eyes twinkled with
startling effect. He waved his hand to them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Endicott! Hello, Benton! You’re
back early, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t stay away, sir,” replied Poke
laughingly. “Missed Greek awfully, sir!”</p>

<p>“Not the first time you’ve missed it—awfully,”
retorted the instructor with a broad
smile. The boys chuckled. “Don’t forget the
meeting to-morrow evening, fellows.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; we’ll be there,” said Gil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s a dandy chap,” he added heartily, as
the instructor passed on toward his room in the
next dormitory. Poke nodded.</p>

<p>“One of the best. That’s why Plato’s the
best society in school. What time is it?”</p>

<p>“Nearly one,” replied Gil, with a yawn.</p>

<p>“Don’t suppose we can get anything to eat
here, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not likely. We might try, but as we’re not
supposed to come until after dinner, I guess it
would look pretty cheeky.”</p>

<p>“Right-O! Besides, it will be more fun eating
in the village. Aren’t you going to unpack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there’s no hurry. Let’s get dinner
now, Poke. We’ll go to Reddy’s; he has
the best eats.”</p>

<p>“Got you! But wait until I get some of this
mess picked up. How’s that for a swell suit of
glad rags, Gil?” Poke held up the jacket for
inspection. It was perceptibly green in color
and decidedly “loud” in style. Gil grunted.</p>

<p>“If you had a gray silk hat you could march
in the minstrel parade with that, Poke. Bet
you sent your measurements by mail with a ten-dollar
bill.”</p>

<p>Poke looked highly offended, and draped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
garment over the back of a chair. Then he
drew away and admired it silently.</p>

<p>“That,” he announced finally, “was made by
one of the best tailors in New York.”</p>

<p>Gil grunted again. “We wouldn’t wear a
thing like that in Providence,” he said.</p>

<p>Poke laughed rudely as he hung the coat up.
“Providence! I believe you, Gil! Providence
never saw anything like that.”</p>

<p>“That’s no joke,” replied the other. “Get
a move on, Poke, I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“All right. Put that in the drawer for me,
will you? No, the table drawer, you idiot!
Where’s my hat? Come on now. I could eat
an ox!”</p>

<p>They closed the door of Number 12 behind
them, scuttled down a flight of well-worn stairs,
and emerged on the granite steps of Weston
Hall. They looked along the fronts of the
buildings, but not a soul was in sight. Gil
chuckled.</p>

<p>“Bet you we’re the first fellows back,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“Sure. They won’t begin to get here until
that two-twenty train.”</p>

<p>They turned to the right, passed between
Weston and Rogers, traversed a few rods of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
turf, and took a path leading downwards
through a grove of maples and beeches. The
path turned and twisted to accommodate itself
to the descent. Gil walked ahead, hat in
hand, since it was close and warm here in the
woods, and Poke lounged along behind, hands
in pockets and his merry, good-humored face
alight with anticipation of the good things
awaiting him at Reddy’s lunch counter. Poke’s
real name was Perry Oldham Kirkland Endicott,
and the nickname had been the natural
result of the first view of the initials
on the end of his suitcase. In age he was sixteen,
one year his companion’s junior. He was
well set-up, with a good pair of shoulders and
a depth of chest that told of athletic training.
He had brown hair and brown eyes, a good-looking
sunburned face, and a general air of
care-free jollity. Like Gil Benton, Poke was a
member of the Upper Middle Class, and consequently
had two more years to spend at Crofton.</p>

<p>Gilbert Benton, seventeen years old, was a
good two inches taller than his chum, and somewhat
slimmer. But the slimness showed wiry
muscles and a healthy body. Gil’s hair was
darker than Poke’s, and his eyes were gray.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
His face spoke of determination and fearlessness.
Seeing the two boys, you would have
said that Gil was the sort to lead bravely a forlorn
hope, and Poke the sort to shrug his shoulders,
laugh—and follow. Gil’s home was in
Providence, Rhode Island, and Poke’s in New
York City. The latter had taken an early train
and Gil had joined him at Providence, and the
two had reached the station at Crofton well before
noon. To arrive at school early and get
settled before their fellows arrived had struck
them as something of a lark.</p>

<p>The woods ceased and the path led them out
onto Academy Road, where Hill Street turned
off and where the village residences began.
Hereabouts most of the trim white-walled structures
were used as boarding- and rooming-houses
for the Crofton students who were unable
to secure accommodations in the school
dormitories. At the corner was Mrs. Hooper’s;
across the road from it, Jones’s; farther up
Academy Road toward the school, Mrs. Sanger’s.
To their left as they leaped the tumble-down
stone wall was a comfortable-looking residence
whose outbuildings nestled in the edge of
the woods.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_12">“Well, what do you think of that!” ejaculated Poke.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12-<br />13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder who has the Timberlake place this
year,” said Gil. “I see it’s rented.”</p>

<p>“Why did she give it up?” asked Poke
idly.</p>

<p>“Went out West to live with her son, I believe.
I don’t believe the old lady ever made
much money here.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p011">“Well, what do you think of that!” ejaculated
Poke</a>, stopping in his tracks and staring
at the house in question. Perched on a short
ladder was a boy of about Poke’s age, nailing
a sign over the front steps. A girl in a white
dress and with a long braid of yellow hair aglint
in the sunshine was steadying the ladder. As
the boys stopped to look, the last screw went
home and the sign stood forth for all to see:</p>

<p class="noic">SUNNYWOOD COTTAGE</p>

<p>The boy descended from the ladder, and he
and the girl stepped a little distance down the
short walk toward the gate to admire the result
of their labors. Gil and Poke went on, the latter
chuckling.</p>

<p>“‘Sunnywood Cottage,’” he murmured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Guess there wasn’t anything very sunny about
the place when Mrs. Timberlake had it. I wonder
who the girl is?”</p>

<p>“Miss Sunnywood,” replied Gil instantly.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Poke, turning to steal another
look at the young lady. “You’re a veritable
mine of information, Gil. The house is
looking rather nice, isn’t it? Must have
painted it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and her hair is very pretty,” laughed
Gil.</p>

<p>“Oh, you run away,” Poke retorted.
“Wonder who the chap is?”</p>

<p>“You seem mighty interested in the family.
Like to call there on the way back?”</p>

<p>“That’s not a bad idea! We might make believe
we wanted to rent a room.”</p>

<p>“We might,” Gil laughed. He, too, turned
for a glance at the cottage. “Guess a fellow
could be pretty comfy at Sunnywood. Funny,
isn’t it, how some houses look homey and comfy
and others sort of give you the creeps. Look
at Jones’s; wouldn’t live there for a hundred
dollars a month!”</p>

<p>“I wonder if a fellow has more fun living in
the village,” mused Poke. “Of course it’s nice
being in hall when you know there are loads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
chaps envying you your room, but, after all, we
don’t have much chance for larks, what with
study hour, and being in at ten, and all that. I
believe I’d like to try a house next year, Gil.”</p>

<p>“Sunnywood?” asked Gil slyly.</p>

<p>Poke grinned and nodded. “I wouldn’t
mind. That corner room in front on this side
ought to be pretty nice. You’d get lots of sun
and light—and that’s more than we get in
Number 12.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind about sun and light now.
Let’s hit it up, Poke. What I need is food and
drink. Thank goodness we’re nearly there!
It’s pretty hot for September, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how hot it is for September,”
replied Poke with a grin, as they turned into
Main Street, “but it’s uncomfortably hot for
Poke!”</p>

<p class="cap">“It’s a perfectly jimmy sign!” declared the
girl delightedly.</p>

<p>The boy turned with an amused smile.
“What’s a ‘jimmy’ sign, Hope? One made
by Jim?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not exactly. Jimmy means awfully
nice—something very—very pleasing—quite
<em>darling</em>! See?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered her brother. “It’s
as plain as the nose on your face.”</p>

<p>“My nose isn’t plain,” was the retort.
“It’s a real Hazard nose, just like yours and
Lady’s.”</p>

<p>“Sort of a jimmy nose,” laughed the boy.
“Sis, if you keep on coining words, you’ll have
to publish a vocabulary or no one will be able
to understand you. What was it you called the
back room upstairs yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Snudgy,” replied Hope Hazard gravely.
“And that’s just what it is; small and hot and—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<em>snudgy</em>! It’s the snudgiest room I ever
saw, Jim.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let Jane hear you call it snudgy.
She might leave. But, say, that’s a pretty
good-looking sign, isn’t it? I don’t believe any
one could tell it was home-made, eh?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not unless they looked real close. I
guess that Y is a little bit wipsy, though,
Jim.”</p>

<p>Jim Hazard frowned intently for a moment
at the letter in question. “Well, maybe it is
kind of out of plumb with the others,” he acknowledged.
“Just the same, I think I’m a
pretty good sign painter, sis. Now what’s to
do?”</p>

<p>“Curtains in the front room upstairs; the
rented one,” replied Hope promptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang the curtains!” grumbled Jim.</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant,” laughed Hope.
“Never mind, they’re the last ones. And we
really must get them up because our star
boarder may come any moment.”</p>

<p>“All right,” he answered resignedly, “but
I’ve got to cool off first.” He seated himself
on the top step and Hope perched herself beside
him. Jim fanned himself with the screw-driver,
and they both laughed. Then the boy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
smile died away, and his forehead puckered itself
into lines of worry.</p>

<p>“Hope, we’ve got to do better than this or
Sunnywood will be vacant again. Four rooms
to rent and only one taken! Didn’t you think
from what Mr. Gordon said that we’d get all
the fellows we wanted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but maybe they don’t look for rooms
until they get here,” she answered cheerfully.
“And you know they don’t begin to come until
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that,” he answered. “Fellows
wouldn’t come and not know where they
were going to live. I don’t think Mr. Gordon
has treated us fairly, Hope. That lady over
there—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sanger.”</p>

<p>“Took the sign out of her window this morning.
I guess that means that her rooms are
all taken. I’ll bet Mr. Gordon has been sending
the fellows to the other houses and leaving us
out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wouldn’t do that,” Hope protested,
“after all the nice things he said to mama.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. Besides, we don’t know just
what nice things he did say. You know very
well that if a person doesn’t actually call Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
names she thinks they’ve been as nice as pie to
her. Wish I had her gift of thinking the very
best of everything and everybody. Well, if
something doesn’t happen pretty soon, I’m
going to see Mr. Gordon and tell him what I
think about it. One thing we do know is
that he wrote Lady that if she took the house
she wouldn’t have any trouble in renting the
rooms.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hope for the best, Jim,” said his
sister, laying a small brown hand on his shoulder
and giving him a reassuring pinch.</p>

<p>“That’s you all over,” he muttered.
“Guess they knew what they were about when
they named you Hope.”</p>

<p>“Well, they didn’t name you Despair,” she
laughed, “so don’t try and play they did. It’s
most time Lady was back, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded and looked down the street toward
the village a half-mile away. “That’s
her now, I guess; away down by the big elm;
see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. Let’s go and meet her, Jim.
She’s probably got a lot of things to carry.”</p>

<p>“All right!” Jim laid down the screw-driver
and pushed the ladder aside. “You’d
better put a hat on, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nonsense! The sun won’t hurt me. Come
on.”</p>

<p>They went out of the gate together, and
walked briskly down the sidewalk. Jim was
half a head taller than his sister, rather thin,
a bit raw-boned, in fact, but strong looking, and
good looking, too, in spite of a smudge of dirt
across his forehead and a generally begrimed
appearance due to the fact that he had been
sign-painting, carpentering, and house-cleaning
all the forenoon. Besides this, he wore the very
oldest clothes he owned, and that he managed to
look prepossessing in spite of these handicaps
speaks rather well for him. He had brown hair
and brown eyes, but the hair was light, extremely
light in places, as though it had been
faded by sun and weather, and the eyes were
very dark. Hope had told him once that he had
perfectly lovely eyes, they looked so much like
sweet chocolate! For the rest, Jim was tanned
and hardy-looking, with more often than not a
little puckery frown on his forehead, for at sixteen
years of age he had already been head of
the family for three years.</p>

<p>Hope Hazard isn’t quite so easily described,
and I’d flunk the task if I might. She was fourteen,
slender, golden-haired, gray-eyed, light-hearted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
As Jim had said, she had been well
named, for hopefulness was the key-note of her
nature, and Jim, who was somewhat prone to
borrow trouble if he had none of his own, called
her frivolous in moments of exasperation.
But Hope came honestly by her sunny optimism,
for her mother had always been the most
hopeful, cheerful soul in the world, and even
Mr. Hazard’s death and the immediate collapse
of the family fortunes had failed to change
her.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter looked much alike.
Mrs. Hazard was quite tall, still young looking,
and still pretty. She had gray eyes, like
Hope’s, and if they were a trifle more faded,
they still twinkled brightly at the slightest provocation.
Jim was more like his father, a little
more serious, with something of New England
granite showing in his face, a heritage from a
race of coast-dwelling Hazards. The Hazard
nose, which Hope fondly believed she had inherited,
and which was a straight and stern appendage,
well shaped but uncompromising, was
his, while Mrs. Hazard’s nose was an undignified,
even flippant affair that looked for all the
world as though, had it had proper encouragement
at an early stage, it would have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tip-tilted. Truth compels the admission that in
Hope’s case the Hazard nose was more a matter
of anticipation than realization, in spite of the
fact that she religiously pulled it and pinched it
in the attempt to make it conform to Hazard
requirements. Perhaps it is a mean thing to
say, but Hope’s nose was more remarkable for
the cluster of three big freckles on the end of it
than for beauty of contour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazard yielded her packages to the children
and gave an account of her shopping expedition.
“It’s lots of fun buying things in Crofton,
my dears; quite exciting. You never know
when you ask for a thing what you are going to
get. I tried to buy some scrim to make curtains
for Jane’s room, and what do you suppose I got?
Why, some muslin for a next summer dress for
Hope! It was really very sweet and pretty.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose,” said Jim, with a smile,
“that when Hope isn’t wearing it, Jane can
hang it up at her window.”</p>

<p>“I think you’ll have to do the shopping,
Jim,” continued Mrs. Hazard. “They don’t
take me seriously, I’m afraid. If I want a
wash-board, they smile at me humoringly and
sell me a nutmeg grater! And two or three
things I meant to get, I forgot all about!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you get the blankets, Lady?” asked
Jim anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; and the toweling, and the mat for
the front door. But I forgot bluing and soap
and meat for supper.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we don’t rent some rooms we won’t
be able to afford supper,” replied Jim grimly.
“I don’t think Mr. Gordon has been treating
us decently, Lady.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure he has done all he could, dear.
I can’t doubt that after the nice way he talked.”</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap,” growled Jim. “Why
doesn’t he send some boys here to rent our
rooms?”</p>

<p>“He will, I’m sure. You wait and see.”</p>

<p>“That woman over there has taken her sign
down already.”</p>

<p>“But she’s been here for years, Jim dear,
while we are only starting. It’s going to take
time, of course. Meanwhile we have that
Latham boy—”</p>

<p>“And he’s a cripple,” interrupted Jim,
“and I dare say no one else would take him!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that at all,” protested his
mother as they entered the gate, “for Mr.
Gordon said that he was sending him to me because
he wanted a place where the poor boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
could be well looked after. Oh, how nice your
sign looks! I suppose it is perfectly all right
to have a sign, Jim, but I see none of the other
houses have any.”</p>

<p>“That’s the point,” replied Jim. “This is
going to be different. Fellows who come here
are going to be at home; this isn’t going to be
just a plain boarding-house, Lady. Isn’t it
most dinner time? I’m pretty hungry.”</p>

<p>“You shall have it right away. I’ll tell
Jane I’m back.” She hurried through to the
kitchen, and Jim, with a sigh, picked up his
step-ladder and, followed by Hope, trudged upstairs
to hang the curtains in the corner room.</p>

<p>“I wonder what sort of a cripple he is,”
mused Hope, as she paired the strips of flounced
muslin. “I do hope he will be nice.”</p>

<p>“I wish Mr. Gordon had sent his cripple
somewhere else,” muttered her brother as he
worked the brass pole through the heading.
“Anybody can impose on Lady.”</p>

<p>“Jim, you’re perfectly awful to-day! You’re
just one long wail of despair. I guess you want
your dinner. Boys are always grumpy when
they’re hungry. Here’s a hole in this curtain.
I’ll draw it together after dinner.”</p>

<p>“It’s good enough for him,” growled Jim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
who was working himself rapidly into a fit of
ill-temper. “I dare say we’ll have to lug him
up and down stairs, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t believe he’s that kind of a cripple,”
responded Hope. “And he has a perfectly
jimmy name, hasn’t he? Jeffrey
Latham; it’s quite a—a romantic sort of name,
Jim.”</p>

<p>“He’s probably a pasty-faced little milksop.
There, that’s the last, thank goodness! My,
it’s no wonder I’m hungry!” he added, as he
looked at his nickel watch. “It’s half-past
two and after!”</p>

<p>“It can’t be!”</p>

<p>“It is, though. Hello, what’s that?” He
pushed the new curtains aside at a front window
and looked out. “It’s a carriage—with a
trunk—and bags! I’ll bet it’s the cripple,
Hope! Run and tell Lady!”</p>

<p>His sister hurried downstairs, and Jim, lugging
his step-ladder with him, followed more
slowly, grumbling as he went. “It’s a wonder
he couldn’t stay away until the room was ready
for him.” He put the ladder out of the way
and went out onto the porch in time to see the
driver of the carriage open the door and the
rubber-tipped ends of a pair of crutches appear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Still resentful, Jim went down the path and
reached the gate just as the occupant of
the vehicle swung himself nimbly to the sidewalk.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p027">“This is Mrs. Hazard’s, isn’t it?”</a> he asked
of Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes. I suppose you’re Latham.”</p>

<p>Jim’s tone was not very gracious and the
newcomer looked a little surprised. He was a
slight, nice looking boy of fifteen, with big wistful
brown eyes set in a somewhat pale but cheerful
face. He was dressed extremely well, even
expensively, and was quite immaculate from the
crown of his Panama hat to the tips of his
smart tan shoes. As he turned to speak to the
driver he looked like any healthy, normal boy,
for he appeared well built, straight of back and
limb, and it was only when he crossed the sidewalk
to the gate that any imperfection showed.
Then Jim saw that one foot, the left one, swung
clear of the ground by several inches.</p>

<p>“If you’ll tell the man where my room is he
will take my baggage up,” said Jeffrey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hazard met him on the porch, while
Hope, frankly curious, hovered in the background.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 428px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28-<br />29]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you,” said Jim’s mother
as she shook hands with Jeffrey. “I’ll show
you your room, and then you must come down
and have some dinner with us. This is my
daughter Hope, and my son you’ve already met.
And I am Mrs. Hazard. I almost forgot to introduce
myself, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey bowed to Hope. “Thank you,
ma’am,” he answered, “I’d like to go to my
room, but I’ve had my dinner. I stopped at the
lunch room.”</p>

<p>“Lunch room! Good gracious!” exclaimed
Mrs. Hazard, “that’s no dinner for a grown
boy! Of course you’ll have something with us;
although we’re hardly settled yet, and our meals
are still rather skimpy.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey murmured thanks as he followed her
upstairs, abandoning one of his crutches and
helping himself along by the banister. The
driver followed with his trunk, and Jim and
Hope were left alone in the hall.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a perfect shame?” cried Hope indignantly,
when the star boarder was out of
hearing. “He’s such a nice boy!”</p>

<p>“Isn’t what a shame?” growled Jim.</p>

<p>“Why, his being like that! Having to go
about on crutches! We must be awfully kind to
him, Jim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh!” Jim picked up the boy’s bags and
started upstairs. “Guess I’d be willing to use
crutches if I could wear clothes like his and buy
bags like these!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim!” protested Hope. “That’s an
awful thing to say! You shouldn’t talk like
that even—even in fun.”</p>

<p>Jim grunted and went on. “Bet you,” he
said to himself, “he will kick about his room.
The carpet’s worn out and there ought to be
new paper on the walls.” But if Jeffrey
Latham observed these things, no one would
have suspected it.</p>

<p>“What a bully room!” he was saying as Jim
entered. “Isn’t it nice and sunny? May I
keep my trunk in here, Mrs. Hazard?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. Between the window and
the bureau would be a good place, wouldn’t it?
I’m so glad you like the room. It’s the pleasantest
in the house.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey took out a pigskin purse and opened
it, exhibiting what looked to Jim like a good
deal of money. “How much do I owe you?”
he asked the driver.</p>

<p>“One dollar, sir. Fifty cents for you, sir,
and the trunk and bags extry.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Jim sharply. “He’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
trying to do you, Latham. Seventy-five’s all it
ought to be.”</p>

<p>“With a heavy trunk and two bags like
them!” demanded the driver incredulously.
Jeffrey laughed.</p>

<p>“I dare say the trunk was heavy,” he said
as he paid the amount asked. “Thank you
very much.”</p>

<p>The driver, mollified, touched his hat and
took his departure. Jim looked his disgust at
such a reckless waste of money.</p>

<p>“The bathroom is just down the hall on the
left,” explained Mrs. Hazard. “Dinner is
ready, but you needn’t hurry. Your name is
Jeffrey, isn’t it? You see, I must know what
to call you.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, it’s Jeffrey, but I’m generally
called Jeff. I’ll just wash a bit and come right
down, although I’m really not hungry.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Hope was right in her theory that
what Jim needed was food, for after he had had
his soup he forgot his peevishness. Mrs. Hazard
did most of the talking, although Hope
showed unmistakable symptoms of being quite
willing to help out. Jeffrey answered questions
unreservedly. They learned that his
home was in Poughkeepsie, New York; that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
was entered in the Lower Middle Class; that
he had never been away from his folks before,
although he had evidently traveled about a good
deal; and that while others might pity him for
his infirmity, he wasted no pity on himself, but
was quite cheerful and contented.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I like reading pretty well,” he said
in answer to one of Mrs. Hazard’s questions,
“but I like to be out of doors better. There
isn’t much I can do myself, but I like to see
other fellows have fun. I’m crazy about
football and baseball and things like that.
At home I’m always running around to the
games.”</p>

<p>“It must be very hard,” murmured Mrs.
Hazard sympathetically, “not to be able to—to
take part in them. But I do think you get
about wonderfully on your crutches.”</p>

<p>“I ought to,” laughed Jeffrey. “I’ve been
practising all my life. I’ve had this bum leg
ever since I was born. Oh, you get used to
it; used to not being able to do things like other
fellows, I mean. Besides, I’ve seen chaps
worse off than me. I <em>can</em> row a little.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could,” said Jim, making his second
remark of the meal.</p>

<p>“I guess you could if you tried,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Jeffrey. “It isn’t hard. I suppose there are
boats here?”</p>

<p>“Lots,” said Jim. “They have crews, too,
you know.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey nodded. “Yes, that’s partly why I
came here. I’ve always been fond of boat
racing. At Poughkeepsie, you know, we have a
lot of it every year. Are you—do you go to
Crofton?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jim, passing his plate for
a second helping, “I begin to-morrow. We’re
in the same class, too.”</p>

<p>“Really? And are there other fellows
here?”</p>

<p>“In the house? No, not yet. We’ve got
three other rooms, but yours is the only one
taken.”</p>

<p>“We hope to rent the others,” explained
Mrs. Hazard. “This is our first year here.
We have always lived in Essexport; that’s on
the coast, you know; but when Jim decided that
he’d rather go to Crofton than anywhere else,
we decided that we couldn’t do without him.
So we rented our house at home and took this.
My husband died three years ago and since then
Jim has looked after us. Hope and I are awful
babies, aren’t we, Hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Speak for yourself, Lady! Jim and I—
Listen! There’s somebody going upstairs!”</p>

<p>“I’ll see who it is.” Jim laid aside his napkin,
pushed back his chair and hurried out. In
the hall he was just in time to see the end of a
bag disappear about the turn of the landing.
He ran up the stairs, wondering. At the open
door of Jeffrey’s room stood, bag in hand, a big
thick-set boy of apparently seventeen years of
age. He had a good deal of color in his cheeks,
very dark eyes and a mass of unruly black hair
under the funny little crimson cap perched on
the back of his head. He turned at the sound
of Jim’s approach and scowled at him across
the banisters.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Hello,” replied Jim, taking at the instant a
strong dislike to him. “Do you want a
room?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m looking for four-leaved clovers,”
he replied with a grin. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Hazard,” answered Jim, beginning
to lose his temper, “and I happen to
live here, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind,” laughed the other unpleasantly.
“What I want to know is why
isn’t my room ready?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your room?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Those your things in there? If
they are, dump ’em out, Bunker—or whatever
your name is.”</p>

<p>“If you want a room I’ll show you one,”
said Jim, “but that room’s taken.”</p>

<p>“Taken? You bet it’s taken! I took it last
year, and if you don’t dump that trunk and
those bags out I will.”</p>

<p>“That room is rented to a fellow named
Latham,” answered Jim warmly. “Who the
dickens are you, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Who am I? I’m Brandon Gary, that’s
who I am. And I engaged this room from
Mother Timberlake last June. And what’s
more, I mean to have it!”</p>

<p class="cap">The sound of the talking had brought the
others from the table to the hall below,
and now Mrs. Hazard came up the stairs to inquire
anxiously: <a href="#i_p037">“What is it, Jim? Is anything
wrong?”</a></p>

<p>“This fellow says he engaged this room last
spring and means to have it,” replied Jim.</p>

<p>“Engaged this room? But—but how could
you?” Mrs. Hazard observed Brandon Gary
bewilderedly. “We only took the house last
month!”</p>

<p>The claimant had snatched off his crimson
cap at Mrs. Hazard’s appearance on the scene
and when he replied his tone was much more
respectful. “I engaged it from the lady who
had it last year, ma’am, and it’s always been
a rule here that when a house changes hands
the—the new landlady takes it—er—subject
to—to—”</p>

Mrs. Hazard.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38-<br />39]</a></span></p>

<p>“I understand,” said Mrs. Hazard helpfully,
smiling her sweetest, “but I knew nothing about
any reservations. You see, Mrs. Timberlake
left early in the summer and I took the house
from an agent. And he said nothing at all
about any of the rooms being taken. I’m awfully
sorry. But there are three other very
nice rooms for rent—” She paused and
looked at Jim with a look of comical despair.
“Unless they are engaged too!”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe so,” said Gary. He had set
his bag down, thrust his hands into his pockets
and dropped some of his aggressiveness, although
it was plain to be seen that he meant to
have his rights. “You see, ma’am, the fellows
never liked Mother Timberlake much. I didn’t
either, but I’d always had my heart set on this
room, and so, when Kidder graduated last June,
I made a streak over here and nabbed it. I had
a chance at living in hall, too, this year. I’m
sorry you didn’t know about it, but I guess you
can’t expect me to give it up. This chap”—nodding
at Jim—“says you’ve rented the
room to some one else. Well, all he’s got
to do is take one of the other rooms. That’s
easy.”</p>

<p>Gary picked up his bag, walked through the
door and took formal possession. Jim and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Hazard looked at each other at a loss. Jim was
angry clear through, and yet the newcomer
seemed to have the law on his side. “I suppose,”
faltered Mrs. Hazard, “we might let
Mr. Gordon decide.” Jim frowned. Gary had
set his bag on the table, opened it and was
now unpacking. “I’d like to chuck him out the
window!” muttered Jim.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Jeffrey would just as soon have
one of the other rooms,” suggested his mother
weakly. “What do you think?”</p>

<p>“I guess he’d take one and be decent about
it,” answered Jim, eying the intruder with
strong distaste, “only I don’t think it’s fair
to ask him to. I don’t care what the—the
custom is here; no one told us about this room
being engaged, and I don’t believe that fellow
has any right to it.”</p>

<p>At the back of the house a bell pealed and
Mrs. Hazard went and leaned over the banisters.
Jim followed slowly.</p>

<p>“Have you any rooms left?” asked a voice
at the doorway.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Hope. “If you’ll wait a moment
I will call my brother. Will you come inside?”</p>

<p>“Will you see them?” asked Mrs. Hazard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Jim nodded and went down. Hope rejoined
Jeffrey in the dining-room. Near the front
door stood two boys talking together softly.
They had no bags with them, nor was there any
conveyance to be seen outside.</p>

<p>“You wanted to look at a room?” asked
Jim gloomily.</p>

<p>“Please,” replied the taller of the two.</p>

<p>“This way, then. There’s a back room on
this floor to rent and one or two upstairs.”
Jim threw open the door of the chamber opposite
the dining-room and they looked in. It was
not a very attractive apartment, however, and
they didn’t enter.</p>

<p>“I think something upstairs would be nicer,”
said one. He turned, crossed the hall and
looked into the dining-room. “Oh, I beg your
pardon,” he said, “that’s not a bedroom, is
it?” But in spite of his apology he seemed in
no hurry to withdraw.</p>

<p>“That’s the dining-room,” said Jim shortly.</p>

<p>“I see.” The boy gave a final look at the
room—and its occupants—and followed toward
the stairway. “Is the corner room on
that side rented?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jim grimly. “Very much
rented!” Then he stopped on the landing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
faced the two boys. “Say, you fellows aren’t
new here, are you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the elder, “why?”</p>

<p>“I want to know something. We rented a
room to a fellow about a week ago and he came
to-day. That’s he in the dining-room. Now
another chap comes along and says he engaged
the same room from the lady who had the house
last year. It’s the corner room you asked
about. This new chap says we’ve got to stand
by what Mrs. Timberlake did. I don’t think
that’s sense. We never saw her and didn’t
know anything about it. At that rate she may
have rented all the rooms, for all we know!”</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, the chap’s right in a way, I guess.
It is customary. But if he’s a new boy how
does he know so much about it?” This from
the taller of the two.</p>

<p>“He’s not new,” said Jim. “I guess he’s
been here two years or so from the looks of
him. He said his name was—Gerry, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“Gerry? You don’t mean Gary, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it.”</p>

<p>The two boys exchanged glances and began to
chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Bull’ Gary! Sounds like him, doesn’t it?
Is he here now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the room,” answered Jim.</p>

<p>“I think, then, you had better let us talk with
him. Hold on, though. Did you rent the house
from Mrs. Timberlake?”</p>

<p>“No. She left early in the summer. We
rented from an agent, Mr. Simpson.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that simplifies the case, eh, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Like anything,” was the cheerful response.
“Lead us to him.”</p>

<p>“Do you fellows know him?” asked Jim
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Rather! We’re very dear friends of his.
You leave it all to us.”</p>

<p>They went on up, bowed to Mrs. Hazard, who
still waited in the hall, and made for the corner
room. Jim dropped back.</p>

<p>“Well, well, if it isn’t Bull!”</p>

<p>Gary turned with a doubtful grin.</p>

<p>“Hello, Poke! Hello, Gil! Where’d you fellows
come from? Aren’t living here, are
you?”</p>

<p>“No, we’re still at the old place,” answered
Gil. “Whose room is this, Bull?”</p>

<p>“Mine, of course. Not bad, is it?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s fine and dandy, but I understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that some one else had taken this. Didn’t that
chap downstairs tell us that, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Sure he did. I guess Bull’s spoofing.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he did tell you that,” said Gary.
“But I engaged this room last June from Mrs.
Timberlake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see!” Gil nodded his head. “Well,
that explains it. Too bad, too, for it’s a mighty
pleasant room. Still, there’s one across the hall
that looks pretty decent and I dare say you’ll
be just as happy there, Bull.”</p>

<p>“Me? I’m staying here,” said Gary uneasily.</p>

<p>But Gil shook his head gently and firmly. So
did Poke.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t do that, you see,” said Gil.
“This room belongs to the other chap. You
see, Bull, Mrs. Timberlake gave up the house.
That canceled everything. Then this Mrs.——Mrs.
Whatshername took it from Simpson.
Get me, Bull? Your case isn’t good, old scout.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference!” blustered
Gary. “I engaged this room—”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! Don’t be dense, Bull. Have we
got to explain it all over again to you? Honest,
Gil, he’s the prize dunce, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he understands all right. He’s just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
trying to tease us. Let’s have a look at the
room opposite, Bull.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see the room opposite,”
Gary protested with vehemence.</p>

<p>“Then why not have a look at the back
rooms? Of course, they aren’t as sunny as this,
but I’ve no doubt they’re quite comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay just where I am,” growled Gary.
But there was a tone of uncertainty in his voice.
Gil smiled indulgently. Poke flecked an imaginary
speck of dust from his sleeve.</p>

<p>“Strange how dense some folks are, Gil,”
said the latter. Gary flushed, and tried bluster.</p>

<p>“You fellows think you can come here and
bullyrag me into doing anything you like. Well,
you’re mightily mistaken. I know my rights
and I intend to stand up for them.”</p>

<p>“Noble youth! But you haven’t any rights in
this case, Bull. You’re just making a silly ass
of yourself and being disagreeable. Don’t let’s
have any bother about it, Bull.” This from Gil.</p>

<p>“I rented this room—”</p>

<p>“S-sh! Remember, please, that there’s a
gentleman present,” remonstrated Poke. “Be
sensible, Bull. Honest, you’ve got your signals
mixed.”</p>

<p>Gary looked from one to the other for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
swallowed hard once and yielded. “All
right, but I don’t have to give this room up
unless I want to.”</p>

<p>“You’re doing it, Bull,” responded Poke
sweetly, “because you are the soul of generosity.
Ah, we know you, you rascal!”</p>

<p>“We will examine the other apartments,”
said Gil.</p>

<p>“Not for me,” growled Gary. “If I can’t
have this room I don’t want to stay in this hole.
I’ll go back to Sanger’s.” He began to pile his
things back in his bag. Gil and Poke eyed each
other dubiously.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe I’d do that,” said Gil
finally. “This is a perfectly good house, Bull,
and the landlady hasn’t let many of her
rooms—”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if she hasn’t! I hope she
won’t! You can make me give up this room,
but you can’t make me stay here!”</p>

<p>Gil and Poke recognized the truth of that.
Gary slammed his bag shut, seized his cap and
strode wrathfully downstairs and out the door
with neither a glance nor word for Mrs. Hazard
or Jim.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve lost you a—a tenant,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
said Gil to Mrs. Hazard. “We didn’t mean
for him to leave the house.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. It was very kind of
you to straighten it out about the room. We’re
so much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he’s gone,” declared Jim. “I
don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“Jim dear,” remonstrated his mother, “you
mustn’t say that. He may be a very nice boy
for all we know. Has my son shown you the
rooms we have to let?” she added, turning to
Gil.</p>

<p>“Er—yes, thanks; that is, he was showing
them when—”</p>

<p>“This room over here is quite pleasant,” she
said, leading the way to the door across the
hall. “It has only one bed in it, but we can set
up another one if necessary. Were you both
thinking of coming?”</p>

<p>Poke looked a trifle uneasy, but Gil came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>“We’ve been rooming in hall, ma’am, and
were just sort of looking around to see what
there was. We’re not decided yet.” He looked
at the room. “I suppose this gets the afternoon
sun until quite late.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” replied Mrs. Hazard. “It’s
quite a warm room in winter, I’m told.”</p>

<p>Poke looked in over Gil’s shoulder. It really
was a very jolly-looking room. It was big and
square, with two broad windows on the front
and a bay on the side. The furnishings were
neither new nor elaborate, but there was a
roomy bureau, a big library table that had seen
better days, two good easy chairs, two straight-backed
ones and a washstand. And of course
there was a bed, a simple white-enameled iron
bed that looked both clean and comfortable.
On the walls were hung several pictures, the
windows had neat dimity curtains and the floor
was covered with a cheerful red and gray carpet
which, if it showed wear in some places, was
still quite presentable. There was a fireplace
and mantel, too, and the fireplace looked as
though it could be used.</p>

<p>“It’s a very nice room,” said Poke warmly.</p>

<p>“Dandy,” said Gil. “I suppose we—I suppose
whoever had it could have a fire there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should think so,” answered Mrs. Hazard.
“But I hope that the furnace will keep
the house warm enough without having to use
the grates.”</p>

<p>“How much would this room be?” asked Gil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I suppose—” Mrs. Hazard turned to
Jim for assistance—“I suppose for two it
would be ten dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“Eleven,” said Jim firmly. “But we don’t
charge for board, of course, when you are
away. Then you just pay three dollars for the
room.”</p>

<p>“That seems reasonable,” declared Poke.</p>

<p>“Quite,” agreed Gil.</p>

<p>“I dare say if we wanted a fire any time we
could have it by paying something extra?”
Poke asked.</p>

<p>“Just pay for what you burn,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“I see.” Gil turned to Poke. “What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Why, we—we might think it over a little,”
gasped Poke.</p>

<p>“Better let us know pretty soon,” said Jim
in businesslike tones. “We couldn’t hold it for
you, of course.”</p>

<p>“N-no,” replied Gil, “I suppose not.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Gil and Poke stared
fascinatedly at each other. Finally:</p>

<p>“I guess,” blurted Gil, “we’ll say we’ll take
it!”</p>

<p>“But, Gil!” cried Poke. “Don’t you think—
Hadn’t we better talk it over a bit first?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, maybe we had. We—we’ll let you
know in—in an hour.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” murmured Poke as they
made their escape downstairs.</p>

<p>Once out of sight of the house Gil pulled up
and leaned against the fence. “That—that
was awful!” he gasped. “In another minute
we’d have rented the room!”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” agreed Poke solemnly.
“How the dickens did we get started?”</p>

<p>“How did we get started?” exclaimed the
other indignantly. “Why, you insisted on going
in there to look at rooms, you idiot!”</p>

<p>“Well, you asked how much it was, didn’t
you? It was all safe enough until then.”</p>

<p>“Now, hang it, Poke, I feel as though we’d
ought to take it; as though it was our duty!
After all, you know, we drove Bull away.”</p>

<p>“How can we take it, you simpleton?
Haven’t we got a room already? Honest, Gil,
you oughtn’t to be trusted out alone! If it
hadn’t been for me we’d been saddled with two
rooms now!”</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you help me? You could
see that I was—was hypnotized!”</p>

<p>“I guess I was too,” laughed Poke. “I
never knew before how easy it is to buy something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
you don’t want! Not that I wouldn’t like
to have that room, though. It’s a peach, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s about twice the size of Number 12.
I wonder what it would be like to have all the
light and sunshine you wanted.”</p>

<p>“I’m crazy about the windows,” said Poke.
“We could have a seat built in that bay, Gil.”</p>

<p>“Sure. And with our pictures and stuff to
fix up with the room would look dandy.”</p>

<p>“Great!” sighed Poke.</p>

<p>There was a silence. At last:</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose J. G. would let us give up
our room now,” observed Gil thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“We might find out,” answered Poke. They
turned by common impulse and stared at each
other. Then Poke broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Let’s do it!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Gil grinned. “All right,” he answered.</p>

<p>They shook hands on it.</p>

<p class="cap">At a quarter before five that afternoon the
expressman landed the last of Gil’s and
Poke’s belongings in the corner room at Sunnywood
Cottage. On his final trip upstairs the
expressman carried a waste-basket filled with
books and a crimson sofa pillow embroidered
with a gray C. Gil paid him, closed the door
behind him and then with a shout of triumph
seized the cushion and hurled it across the room
at Poke. As Poke was at that instant bent over
a suit case, extracting a miscellaneous assortment
of books, balls, pens, shoes and so forth
from it, and as the cushion struck him square
between his shoulders, the result was interesting
and spectacular. Poke’s head went into the suit
case and his feet flew out behind him. Gil,
chortling gleefully, watched Poke recover his
equilibrium. Then, by deftly dropping to the
floor at the psychological moment, he escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the rubber-soled shoe that sang across the room
and banged against the door. He picked up the
missile and tossed it back. Poke caught with
one hand, swooped down and tagged the suit
case. Gil waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Out at the plate!” he yelled.</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other and grinned.</p>

<p>“Get busy,” said Poke finally. “It’s most
five o’clock. Say, you hate to unpack, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Observe the trouble I saved myself at hall,”
said Gil, pointing to his trunk. “If I’d unpacked
there, as you did, I’d have had it all to
do over again. See?”</p>

<p>“Well, as we aren’t likely to move again to-day
you’d better get busy. Say, it was a great
scheme of ours to get here early and be all settled
ahead of the others, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Marvelous,” agreed Gil ironically. “See
us now!”</p>

<p>Poke looked over the room and grinned.
“Looks as though it had been struck by a cyclone,
doesn’t it? Say, this is a dandy big
closet.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t hog it all. Seen my trunk key
anywhere?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw it on the window sill at hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, feathers! Well, I’m not going back for
it to-night. Let’s try yours, Poke.”</p>

<p>“Won’t fit. You tried it last year. Get a
hammer.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“Put your fool head out in the hall and yell
for one.”</p>

<p>“All right. Say, Poke, weren’t you surprised
when J. G. let us off on our room?”</p>

<p>“Rather! But I dare say there are plenty of
fellows who’ll be glad of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, they can have it! I like this ten
times better. Of course we’re paying a little
more—”</p>

<p>“About fifty cents a week more,” said Poke
scornfully, “and what’s that? I’ll bet Mrs.
Hazard will give us better things to eat than we
got at school. And anyway it will be more—more
homelike.”</p>

<p>“‘Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like
home,’” sang Gil as he opened the door. Then,
“Say, Poke, who shall I yell for?”</p>

<p>“Yell for a hammer, of course.”</p>

<p>“Hammer! Hammer!” cried Gil softly.
“It doesn’t come, Poke! What’s the chap’s
name?”</p>

<p>“Hazard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“First name, I mean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he wouldn’t like to have me
get familiar on so short an acquaintance,” reflected
Gil. “I guess I’ll go down and find
some one.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get lost,” advised Poke.</p>

<p>Gil didn’t have to search far, for Jim was in
the lower hall. Gil explained his quandary.</p>

<p>“I guess I can get it open for you without
prying the hasp off,” said Jim. “Wait a minute
and I’ll get some keys.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later Jim lifted the lid in triumph.
“There you are,” he said. “Say, you
fellows have got a raft of truck, haven’t you?
Going to put all those pictures up?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” answered Gil, “if there’s room
for them.”</p>

<p>“Better let me help you, then,” said Jim.
“Tell me where you want them to go. I’ll get
the step-ladder.”</p>

<p>“He’s a good-hearted kid,” observed Poke as
Jim hurried off.</p>

<p>“Your friend came back again,” announced
Jim as he returned with the ladder, “just after
you telephoned. Said he’d decided to take this
room. I told him we’d just rented it and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
as mad as a hornet. You would have thought
that we’d cheated him out of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s like Bull Gary,” said Gil. “He
has an overdeveloped sense of importance.”</p>

<p>“He’s got an ingrowing ego,” said Poke.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what that is,” laughed Jim,
“but it sounds bad.”</p>

<p>“It’s awful,” Poke assured him solemnly.
“Let’s put that one over the bed, Hazard.
Want help?”</p>

<p>“No, you fellows go on and get your things
unpacked. We have supper in about an hour.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable,” said Gil.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know how you managed that fellow
the way you did,” said Jim presently.</p>

<p>“Who? Gary?” asked Gil. “Well, not to
make a mystery of it, Hazard, we all belong to
the same society, Plato, and in Plato every fellow
is supposed to act decently. Bull wasn’t
acting decently and he knew it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you have societies here?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Four,” was the reply. “There’s Plato,
which is the best, and to which Endicott and I
belong—”</p>

<p>“Also Bull Gary,” said Poke dryly. “But
Bull was an accident.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“And Pindar, Homer and Hesiod,” continued
Gil.</p>

<p>“Are they secret societies? How does a fellow
get into them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re secret. And a fellow doesn’t
get into them; he’s taken in. Each society has
from thirty to forty members. New members
are taken in each year during Winter Term.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Jim, moving the ladder to a
new location. “I thought maybe you could be
proposed and get in that way.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Poke. “Are you at
school?”</p>

<p>“I’m starting to-morrow,” replied Jim.
“I’m in the Lower Middle Class. I suppose
you fellows are beyond that, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“One year,” replied Gil. “I didn’t know
you were one of us, Hazard. What do you think
of our seat of learning?”</p>

<p>“I like it,” answered Jim warmly. “I’ve always
wanted to come here.”</p>

<p>“Know many fellows?” asked Poke.</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. “Not a one.”</p>

<p>“Wrong, Mr. Hazard,” said Gil; “you know
two. Mr. Perry Oldham Kirkland Endicott and
Mr. Gilbert Benton, two of the Academy’s most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
prominent and representative members. Bow,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“Happy to meet your inquaintance,” murmured
Poke politely.</p>

<p>“Well, I know you fellows a little,” laughed
Jim, “and I know the chap across the hall in
the same way. But that’s all.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. You’ll soon know
plenty of fellows. Who is the chap you spoke
of?”</p>

<p>“His name is Latham, Jeffrey Latham, and
he comes from Poughkeepsie. He’s a sort of a
cripple. One leg’s shorter than the other. He
says he was born that way. He seems a nice
sort of fellow, and I was mighty glad that Gary
didn’t get his room from him.”</p>

<p>“Cripple, eh? That’s hard lines. What
class is he in?”</p>

<p>“Lower Middle, same as me.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re all Middlers here. Is the young
lady your sister, Hazard?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Hope’s going to High School when it
starts. It’s her first year.”</p>

<p>“Is your father here?” asked Poke.</p>

<p>“No, he’s dead,” answered Jim. “Died
about three years ago. That’s why we’re here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
doing this. Everything went smash when dad
died.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Poke sympathetically.
“Never mind the rest of those pictures.
You’ve done enough already. Besides, I’m going
to knock off work and get ready for supper.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t many more to go up,” said
Jim. “I’ll stick ’em under this bed.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that we must telegraph this
evening, Poke,” said Gil. “We can telephone
to the office from here.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” answered Poke, adding in explanation
to Jim, while a broad smile enveloped
his countenance. “You see, Hazard, we’ve got
to get permission from home to change our
lodgings.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve already done it!” exclaimed
Jim. “Suppose—suppose your folks won’t
let you?”</p>

<p>Visions of having the room back on his hands,
empty again, gave him an anxious moment.
But Gil smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be all right,” he declared. “I
shall wire, ‘Poke moving to village. Am going
with him. Wire permission.’”</p>

<p>“And I,” said Poke, “shall say, ‘Gil moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to village. Am going with him. Wire permission.’”
He winked at Jim. “Easy,
what?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it works,” laughed Jim.
“Supper will be ready in about ten minutes.
Guess I’ll go and wash up.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged for helping us,” said Gil.
“See you later.”</p>

<p>Sunnywood Cottage may be said to have formally
opened its season that evening at supper.
At one end of the table sat Mrs. Hazard, at the
other Jim. Hope sat at her mother’s right with
Jeffrey Latham beside her, and across from
them were Gil and Poke. Jeffrey was a bit shy
at first, but by the time supper was half over
Gil and Poke had made friends with him and the
meal was a very jolly one.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p061">“This certainly beats dining-hall,” declared
Poke</a>, accepting a second dish of Mrs. Hazard’s
preserves.</p>

<p>“Well, rather!” Gil agreed. “We never
had preserves like this, did we, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Nor cake like this, either,” added Poke,
looking politely expectant at Hope, in front of
whom the cake dish was reposing.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62-<br />63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do have another piece,” said Mrs. Hazard,
smiling with pleasure. “I shall tell Jane that
you like it.”</p>

<p>Poke accepted his third slice demurely.</p>

<p>“Is Jane the cook, ma’am? She’s a dandy,
all right!”</p>

<p>“Jane made the cake,” answered Mrs. Hazard,
“but I can’t trust her yet with all the cooking.
I think she is going to do very nicely after
she has had a little more experience.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, experience is what counts,” said
Poke gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re getting plenty of experience
with that cake,” said Gil dryly. “I guess, Mrs.
Hazard, I ought to warn you now that Poke is
an awful eater.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I don’t begin to eat as much as you
do. Have some more cake, Latham? You
don’t eat much, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do, but Mrs. Hazard made me
take dinner after I came. And I didn’t want
to seem impolite and so I ate a whole lot.”</p>

<p>“Come to think of it,” said Gil, “it’s a
good idea to leave a little room for J. G.’s ice
cream and wafers.”</p>

<p>“By Jove,” exclaimed Poke, “I forgot about
that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-night, do you mean?” asked Jim.
“Do you get things to eat at the reception?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! Ice cream and those sugar
wafers that taste like blotting paper. It’s a
good plan to go early, though; last year the
eats gave out about nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Are you expected to go to it?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Gil. “Of course you don’t
have to, but it’s a pretty good idea to do it,
Hazard. You get a chance to meet fellows, you
see. Faculty too. ‘Boots’—that’s Thurston,
you know; physics;—will tell you about his
trip to Europe, and ‘Kitty’ Clarke—he’s
chemistry—will talk fishing until your head
spins. Besides, you’ll meet Mrs. Gordon, and
she’s a dandy, isn’t she, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We’ll all start about eight. You’re
going, Latham?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ll start a little ahead. I can’t
get along quite as fast as you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re in no great rush. We’ll all go
together. We’d better go by the road, though;
I guess you’d find it pretty hard through the
woods. Let’s telephone those messages to the
telegraph office now, Gil, before we forget it.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were off, Gil and
Poke ahead and Jim and Jeffrey behind, all suiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
their pace to Jeffrey’s. He managed to
swing himself along about as fast as an ordinary
walk, and that was fast enough for any of
them this evening, for all had supped well and
it was still pretty warm, although the sun had
been down for a good half-hour and there was
a little breeze from the west. It was not quite
dark as they followed the winding road, but
when, presently, the school buildings came into
sight beyond the trees lights were agleam in
most of the rooms.</p>

<p>“Seems funny not to be living up there,”
reflected Poke. “I wonder who’ll get our
room.”</p>

<p>“Homesick already?” laughed Gil. “Much
I care who gets it. I believe we’re going to
have a dandy time at—what’s its name?”</p>

<p>“Sunnywood Cottage,” replied Poke as they
turned onto the drive that led past the rear of
Academy Hall to the Principal’s residence.
“Say, I like Mrs. Hazard, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You bet! She’s a lady.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s—she’s sort of like a fellow’s
own mother, isn’t she? And she certainly has
great preserves!”</p>

<p>The house was brilliantly lighted and already
fellows were arriving. Gil and Poke waited at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the steps for the others to come up. Then, settling
their collars and furtively slicking down
their hair, they followed the stream, deposited
their caps in the hall and entered the big library,
already half full of guests. Mr. Gordon, the
Principal, or J. G. as the boys called him, was
receiving with Mrs. Gordon, and toward them
the Sunnywood contingent made their way, Gil
and Poke, however, stopping at least a dozen
times to greet friends. On several occasions
Jim and Jeffrey were introduced, but only one
name stuck in Jim’s memory afterwards, that
of a big, good-looking, broad-shouldered fellow
of nineteen, who squeezed Jim’s hand like a vise
and of whom Gil whispered a moment later as
they passed on: “That’s Duncan Sargent,
football captain; one of the best!” Then Jim
was shaking hands with Mr. Gordon and Mrs.
Gordon and the Principal was saying:</p>

<p>“This is James Hazard, my dear. His
mother has taken the Timberlake house, you
know.”</p>

<p>The Principal was a sturdily built man of
fifty-odd, clean-shaven, with a nice face and a
voice that made you like him instantly. In appearance
he was more the business man than
the scholar. Jim had met Mr. Gordon several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
times already, but Mrs. Gordon he had never
seen. She asked kindly about Jim’s mother and
how the house was prospering. Then another
boy claimed her attention and Jim stepped back
out of the way just as Jeffrey, who had found
difficulty in getting through the throng, reached
Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” greeted the Principal,
shaking hands in his hearty way. “And what
is your name? We haven’t met before, have
we? You must set me right if I am wrong. I
confess that I sometimes forget a face.”</p>

<p>“My name is Latham, sir, Jeffrey Latham.
I came to-day.”</p>

<p>“To be sure! And so you’re Latham, eh? I
believe—yes, I think I might have known it,
my boy, for there is certainly a strong resemblance
to your father. And how is the Senator?
Well, I trust?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I’m pleased to hear it. A fine man, Latham.
I have had the pleasure of meeting him
once or twice in a casual way. I hope you’ll
find your stay with us happy and profitable,
Latham. You must come and take tea with
Mrs. Gordon and me some evening.”</p>

<p>As Jeffrey shook hands with Mrs. Gordon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
turned away Poke Endicott, who had been next
him in line, dragged him aside.</p>

<p>“What did J. G. mean about the Senator,
Latham? Is he your father?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jeffrey.</p>

<p>Poke whistled softly.</p>

<p>“Don’t that beat all!” he ejaculated.
“Why, man alive, Senator Latham and my dad
are regular old cronies. Haven’t you ever
heard him speak of Major Endicott?”</p>

<p>“Lots of times!” cried Jeffrey. “Is that
your father?”</p>

<p>“That’s the dad! Why, say, Latham, you
and I are pretty nearly relatives, aren’t we?”
He grinned and stretched out his hand.
“Senator, I’m pleased to meet you!” he cried.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>MR. HANKS RENTS A ROOM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">With the ringing of chapel bell in the old
stone turret of Academy Hall the next
morning Crofton began its forty-third year.
Seven-fifteen seemed to come extremely early,
for none of the boys in Sunnywood Cottage had
gone to bed until very late the night before.
There had been lots to talk about after the reception
and they had loitered on the way home
and afterwards had congregated in Jeffrey’s
room for a final gossip. Jim, for one, pulled
himself out of bed with a sigh; it seemed to him
that he could have slept until noon to-day. Gil
and Poke were already downstairs when he arrived,
and Jeffrey followed a minute later.
They chose the wood path, Jeffrey protesting
his ability to manage it. And manage it he
did very well, swinging himself along the winding
path, over protruding roots with a remarkable
dexterity.</p>

<p>Chapel was held in the Meeting Room on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
first floor of Academy Hall. It was a large,
square room, taking up the entire east end of
the building. There was a long platform at one
side and facing it were rows of yellow settees.
The walls held many portraits of former Principals,
faculty members and noted graduates and
the big windows were set in deep embrasures
adorned with plaster casts of Greek and Roman
immortals; the students called this array “The
White Company.”</p>

<p>The shrill-toned bell gave its expiring clang
as Jim followed the other three into the room.
Most of the fellows were already in their seats
and his first impression was of a sea of faces
confronting him. They passed row after row of
settees before Gil, who was leading, turned in.
Behind them a boy closed the big door and Mr.
Gordon arose and stepped to the reading desk
on the platform. Whispers ceased as the big
Bible was opened.</p>

<p>“My son, forget not my law; but let thine
heart keep my commandments.</p>

<p>“For length of days, and long life, and peace
shall they add to thee.</p>

<p>“Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind
them about thy neck; write them upon the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of thine heart: so shalt thou find favor and
good understanding in the sight of God and
man.”</p>

<p>The Principal’s deep, pleasant voice went on
to the end of the chapter. Then there was the
rustling of many pages as the hymn-books were
opened and the scraping of feet as the boys
arose. They sang without accompaniment of
any sort, and to Jim, accustomed to the wheezy
droning of the worn-out organ in the little
church at home, the effect was very beautiful.
Then came a prayer, a simple, earnest appeal to
the Almighty for help and guidance throughout
the year just beginning.</p>

<p>“And, O Lord, bless the faculty and the students
of this school: give them strength and
patience to do their work, understanding and
clean hearts to follow Thy laws.”</p>

<p>Then came the Lord’s Prayer, repeated in
unison; a moment of silence; and then the scraping
of feet, the creaking of settees and the
moving of bodies, signifying the end of the
service; signifying too, perhaps, a longing for
breakfast. But Mr. Gordon was not yet
through with them. He said a few words appropriate
to the opening of the school and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
announced the presence on the faculty of a new
member. A tall, thin gentleman of middle age
arose and stepped to the front of the platform.
He wore spectacles and held his head forward in
a near-sighted way.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hanks, young gentlemen,” announced
Mr. Gordon. Mr. Hanks bowed to the right, to
the left, to the center, hesitated nervously and
returned precipitately to his chair. The students
clapped their hands, grinning the while at
the new instructor’s evident delight in reaching
his seat again.</p>

<p>“Hanks, did he say?” whispered Poke to
Jim. “It isn’t hard to guess what his name
will be?”</p>

<p>Jim looked a question and Poke laughed
softly.</p>

<p>“Nancy,” he whispered. “Nancy Hanks;
see?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon dismissed them and there was a
fairly dignified rush for the door, Jim becoming
separated from his companions in the
exodus. He discovered them again outside,
however. Jeffrey, the subject of much polite
curiosity, was leaning on his crutches at the foot
of the steps, while, close by, Gil and Poke made
part of a group of six or seven fellows who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
talking and laughing as fast as they knew how.
Jim joined Jeffrey, but a moment later Gil saw
them and called them over.</p>

<p>“Want you to meet some friends of mine,
fellows,” he said. “Sargent you met last
night, I think. This is Cosgrove. Joe, shake
hands with Hazard and Latham. You too,
Atherton. Likewise Sommers and Heath.
Hazard’s a Lower Middler. How about you,
Latham; what’s your class?”</p>

<p>“The same,” replied Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“You fellows want to come over and see
our new room,” said Poke. “It’s a dandy.
We’ve got hardwood ceilings, hot and cold elevator
service, continuous janitor, telephone in
every room—”</p>

<p>“Dry up, Poke,” laughed Joe Cosgrove.
“Where is it? What did you leave Weston
for?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t like the society there,” replied Poke
gravely. “We’re at Mrs. Hazard’s; this chap’s
mother, you know. She’s taken the Timberlake
cottage. We’ve got a fine old room, honest.
Come over soon, will you?”</p>

<p>Jim became aware that Duncan Sargent was
looking at him in a peculiarly speculative way
as though trying to guess his weight. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
enlightened the next moment when <a href="#i_p075">Sargent
asked</a>:</p>

<p><a href="#i_p075">“You a football man, Hazard?”</a></p>

<p>Jim shook his head. “Not much of one, I’m
afraid. I’ve tried the game but I never made a
success at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, but you’re coming out, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Coming out?” repeated Jim at a loss.</p>

<p>“Yes, to try for the team. This afternoon at
four. We want all the new material we can get
this year and you look as though you might
make good.”</p>

<p>“Why, thanks,” said Jim. “I—I’d like to,
but I won’t have time. You see, we’ve taken
that house and there’s a good deal to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” Sargent looked disappointed. “I
wish you would, though. See if you can’t give
us an hour or so in the afternoon, Hazard. I’m
going to look for you, anyhow.”</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_74">“You a football man, Hazard?” Sargent asked.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76-<br />77]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim murmured vaguely and politely, very
much flattered by the football captain’s interest
in him, and the group broke up. The quartette
hurried back to Sunnywood Cottage as fast as
Jeffrey could go, all very anxious for breakfast.
At nine the school bell rang again and Jim and
Jeffrey—with many another new boy—attended
their first class. But there wasn’t much
real work done that opening day, and at three
o’clock they were free. Jim returned to the
cottage alone. Most of the other fellows were
making for the athletic field to either don canvas
and get into the first day’s practice or to loll
about the grand-stand or on the warm turf and
watch and comment. But Jim had plenty of
work awaiting him at the cottage, for in spite
of the fact that they had been at Crofton for
almost a fortnight there still remained numerous
odds and ends to attend to. Hope, busily
hemming dish-towels on the porch, was eager
to hear about his experiences, but she found her
brother a good deal of a disappointment.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing much happened,” replied
Jim, dumping his books in a chair. “There
was history and French. I have the new man,
Mr. Hanks, in history. He’s awfully funny;
guess he was rattled a bit. Poke calls him
‘Nancy’; not bad, is it?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him, Jim.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to see him to appreciate
that; Nancy Hanks; don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Hope blankly. “But—but
why does he call him Nancy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you know who Nancy Hanks was?
My, you don’t know much United States history,
do you?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” replied Hope humbly.</p>

<p>“Was she a—a nurse or something in the
Revolutionary War, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Of course she wasn’t,” answered Jim disgustedly.
“You’d better read your history,
sis. Where’s Lady?”</p>

<p>“In there.” Hope nodded toward the door.
“She wants you to go down town for something.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ve got to go anyway; got to get
some books and stationery. What are you doing?”</p>

<p>Hope held up the piece of blue-checked linen.
“Dish-cloths.”</p>

<p>“Oh. I suppose we haven’t rented any more
rooms?”</p>

<p>Hope shook her head. “No, there hasn’t
been a soul here—except the ice-man and a
man who wanted to sell us a set of ‘The World’s
Best Literature.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how we’re going to get
along with just those two rooms rented,” said
Jim gloomily. “Endicott said I might advertise
in the school paper, but Benton said it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be wasting money because the fellows don’t
change rooms after school begins.”</p>

<p>“Lady and I were talking about it this afternoon,”
said Hope, biting a thread off with her
teeth and then glancing apologetically at her
brother.</p>

<p>“What have I told you—” began Jim
sternly. But Hope hurried on. “Lady said
she thought we could manage to make expenses
even if we don’t let any more rooms. She says
living isn’t very expensive here in Crofton.
And then, Jim, there’s the rent money from the
house at home.”</p>

<p>“Thirty-three dollars a month! Wait until
we have to buy coal to heat this place! It’s going
to take a lot of fuel, the rooms are so big and
there are so many windows.”</p>

<p>“Well, we may rent another one yet,” replied
Hope cheerfully. “You never can tell,
Jim, and, anyway, it doesn’t do a bit of good to
worry.”</p>

<p>“Some one’s got to do a little worrying,”
answered Jim shortly. “You and Lady don’t
seem to care whether we make this thing go or
not!”</p>

<p>“You’re perfectly horrid! We do care, Jim,
but nobody ever did any good to anybody by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
worrying. Besides, I don’t see that there is
anything we can do but just—just wait.”</p>

<p>“Yes, wait,” said Jim disgustedly. “Sit
here and wait for some one to come along and
insist on being taken in. A lot of rooms we
will rent that way!”</p>

<p>“Well, those boys upstairs did that, didn’t
they? They came along and rented the room,
Jim; nobody worried them into it, did they?”</p>

<p>“Well, you sit here and wait,” growled her
brother. “I’m going down town.” He picked
up his books and turned toward the door. “I’ll
see what Lady wants.” He was back in a few
moments, stuffing a slip of paper, Mrs. Hazard’s
list, into his pocket. “Want to go along,
Hope?”</p>

<p>But Hope shook her head. “I must finish
these, Jim. I’ve got five more to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” He pulled his hat down
over his eyes and started off. Hope looked
after him, sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Jim’s getting growlier and growlier every
day,” she murmured. “I suppose I ought to
worry too; maybe he’d like it better if I did.
The trouble is I don’t seem to be able to.
Every time I get started to be unhappy I think
of something nice and forget! I’m afraid”—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fixed her gaze thoughtfully on the little
round bed of scarlet sage, which was all the
garden the cottage could boast—“I’m afraid
I’m dreadfully fripish. Maybe I have a—a
shallow nature.” Then she smiled, and, “Oh,
dear,” she sighed ruefully, “I can’t worry
even about that!</p>

<p>“Just the same,” she continued in thought
as she sent her needle in and out, “I really
don’t see the use of worrying all the time. It
seems to me that if things go wrong you just
ought to keep cheerful, and the wronger they
go the cheerfuller you ought to keep. You never
know when something nice is going to happen
in this wonderful world. Why, I might be sitting
here just like this and somebody might
come along and say, ‘Young lady, have you any
rooms to rent?’ And I’d say—”</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>Hope looked up with a start. At the end
of the short walk, holding the gate half open,
stood a tall gentleman in rather ill-fitting pepper-and-salt
clothes. On his head, set at a rakish
angle, was a straw hat with a narrow up-rolled
brim. It was very yellow as to straw
and very rusty as to ribbon. And it didn’t
suit his lean, thoughtful face the least bit. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wore spectacles and from behind the lenses a
pair of faded blue eyes peered near-sightedly.
He carried a small book in his right hand, one
finger inserted between the pages to hold his
place. Hope wondered if he could be another
book agent and dropped her work and went to
the steps.</p>

<p>“I regret disturbing you, young lady,” said
the gentleman, “but will you kindly tell me
whether this is—er—” He stopped perplexedly.
Then, “Dear, dear,” he said half
to himself, “what was the name now?”</p>

<p>“This is Mrs. Hazard’s house,” said Hope
helpfully.</p>

<p>“Ah, that was it; Mrs. Hazard!” he said
with vast relief. He entered and closed the
gate carefully behind him, changing the book
from right hand to left as he did so but taking
care to keep his place. “I—<a href="#i_p083">I am looking for
accommodations</a>; lodgings; <a href="#i_p083">a room and—er—yes,
board with it</a>. You give board here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” answered Hope. “If you
will take a seat I will tell my mother you are
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84-<br />85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you.” He took a chair. “My
name is Hanks. I am just beginning my duties
as instructor at the school. The Principal,
Mister—Mister—well, the name doesn’t matter—sent
me here. I had a room—” He
broke off abruptly and exclaimed anxiously;
“Your rooms have plenty of light?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, they’re quite light and sunny.”
Hope had reached the door but politeness
kept her there until the visitor had finished
talking.</p>

<p>“That is excellent. I had a room in one of
the halls; I think it was Roberts—or Rutgers;
now was it that? Well, that’s of no consequence.
I was explaining that the room was
extremely dark, even in midday very little light
penetrating the—er—the windows. As my
eyes are unfortunately quite weak I was obliged
to inform Mister—Mister—”</p>

<p>“Gordon,” prompted Hope gently.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Yes, Mr. Gordon. I was
obliged to inform him that the room would not
be satisfactory. I then learned that there was
no other room to be had at the school. Quite
extraordinary, I would say.”</p>

<p>He paused and seemed to be pondering the
fact. Hope waited. After a moment he looked
up in his funny startled way.</p>

<p>“I—I beg your pardon!” he said confusedly.
“I—I fear I am detaining you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir. I’ll tell my mother that you
are here.”</p>

<p>“If you will be so kind.” He bowed gravely.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hazard was already on the way,
having heard the voices on the porch. As she
came out Mr. Hanks arose from his chair and
bowed. Then, as an afterthought, he removed
his faded straw hat.</p>

<p>“Mama,” said Hope, “this is Mr. Nancy
Hanks—I mean—” She faltered in confusion.
Mr. Hanks came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“I fear you did not get the name quite correctly,”
he said politely. “Artemus Hanks is
the name.”</p>

<p>“He—he is looking for a room,” said Hope
hurriedly, painfully aware that she was blushing
frantically.</p>

<p>“I shall be very glad to show you what we
have,” said Mrs. Hazard with a smile. “Will
you come in?”</p>

<p>“Er—thank you.” Mr. Hanks placed his
book, open and face down, on the chair, put
his hat carefully on top of it and followed.
“I am not very particular, Mrs.—er—Mrs.
Hazel; plenty of light is almost my sole requirement.
Unfortunately, my eyesight—”</p>

<p>They passed out of hearing, leaving Hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
divided between confusion and laughter. How
had she ever been so stupid as to call him
Nancy? The gate slammed and Jim came up
the walk, laden with bundles and looking very
warm.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jim,” she cried softly. “He came and
I called him Mr. Nancy Hanks! Wasn’t that
simply awful?”</p>

<p>“Who came? Mr. Hanks? Came here?
What for?”</p>

<p>“For a room. Just after you went. I was
sitting here—”</p>

<p>“Did he take it?” asked Jim eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He’s still up there. Isn’t
he the funniest, foolishest old dear of a man,
Jim? He couldn’t remember Lady’s name, nor
Mr. Gordon’s—”</p>

<p>“S-sh, they’re coming down,” warned Jim.
The instructor, followed by Mrs. Hazard, came
out of the door.</p>

<p>“I hope you will find it quite light enough,
Professor.”</p>

<p>“Not Professor, ma’am, merely instructor.
I have no doubt the room will be—er—quite
satisfactory. I shall have my things removed
directly.” He caught sight of Jim and bowed.
“How do you do,” he murmured. “Thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you, ma’am.” He bowed to Mrs. Hazard, managing
to include Hope in the salutation, and
started down the steps. Hope, stifling a giggle,
seized his hat and book and ran after him.</p>

<p>“Eh?” he asked bewilderedly. “Oh, thank
you, thank you. My hat—and book; to be
sure. I believe I would have forgotten them.
Thank you, thank you.”</p>

<p>He set his hat on his head, where it immediately
shifted to the same rakish angle as
before, closed the gate carefully behind him,
opened his book and paced slowly off toward
school, reading as he went. Hope subsided in
a chair and gave way to laughter. Jim grinned
in sympathy and Mrs. Hazard said “S-sh!”
warningly, but had to smile too. Then:</p>

<p>“Well, Jim, another room rented,” she said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Fine, Lady! What’s he going to pay?”</p>

<p>“Why—why”—a queer expression came
over Mrs. Hazard’s face—“why, do you know,
Jim, I don’t think he—I—we spoke of the
price at all!”</p>

<p class="cap">“Of course I’m glad you’ve rented your
room,” said Poke with hesitancy, “but—but
it isn’t going to be much fun having a
faculty in the house.”</p>

<p>“We had two in hall,” said Gil.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s two when there are forty
fellows to look after? That’s different. Here
there are only four of us, and, besides, he’s
right next door. Not, of course,” he continued,
assuming an air of conscious virtue, “that I
would think of doing anything—er—out of
the way, but I—one resents the—the espionage.”</p>

<p>“Come again,” requested Gil.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Jim. “I didn’t think
about that.”</p>

<p>They were talking it over on the porch before
supper. Mr. Hanks was already installed
in the room behind Jeffrey’s, his luggage consisting
of four huge boxes of books, one small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
trunk and a battered valise, having arrived simultaneously
with Gil and Poke.</p>

<p>“Piffle!” said Gil. “It doesn’t matter. I
dare say Nancy isn’t the sort to bother us much.
He’s a queer old duffer.”</p>

<p>“Old?” questioned Jim thoughtfully. “I
don’t believe he’s so terribly old, fellows.”</p>

<p>“He looks as though he might be anything
from twenty-five to forty,” said Gil. “I dare
say he’s really about thirty, eh?”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” responded Poke. “Well, it
doesn’t matter as long as he behaves himself
and leaves us alone to our innocent amusements.
I’d hate to have to report him to J. G., though.
Here comes Latham. He manages to get along
pretty well on those sticks of his, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad he’s that way,” said Gil. “He
seems a good sort. Wonder why he doesn’t
wear a thick-soled shoe on that foot. Seems
to me that would be better than using crutches.”</p>

<p>“It’s something about the muscles of that
leg,” explained Jim. “Some of them don’t
work right; I think he said they were the—the
extensive muscles,” ended Jim doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Extensor,” corrected Gil. “He’s mighty
cheerful considering everything, I think.
Hello, Latham! Where have you been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seeing the world,” replied Jeffrey.
“Stumping all over the place. I watched football
practice awhile and went down along the
river afterwards. It’s awfully pretty, isn’t
it?” He seated himself in a chair, leaning his
crutches against his knees. “I saw you two
fellows playing,” he added.</p>

<p>“You saw us working like dogs,” replied
Poke grimly. “Football for the first month
is a whole lot like hard work, Latham. By the
way, Hazard, what happened to you? Aren’t
you going to try for the team? Dun asked
where you were to-day.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have time,” answered Jim.
“Besides, I can’t play; I’ve tried it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t play? How do you know you can’t
play? You let Johnny get at you for a couple
of weeks. Then if he says you can’t play I’ll
believe it. Johnny can make a football player
out of a lump of wood!”</p>

<p>“He did something more wonderful than
that,” said Gil. “He made one out of you,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“Your wit is very cheap, Mr. Benton.”</p>

<p>“Who is Johnny?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Johnny? Johnny is Mr. John Connell, the
best little trainer in the country. He’s a wonder!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Why, half the big schools have been after
him for years, and last spring he had an offer
from Dartmouth! You go and let Johnny look
you over. If he says there’s no hope for you,
all right.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to play well enough,” said Jim,
“but there’s too much to do about the house.”</p>

<p>“Why? What sort of things?”</p>

<p>“Oh, chopping kindling, bringing up coal,
running to the village, cutting grass—”</p>

<p>“Get your coal up in the morning, cut your
kindling at night, telephone to the village and
forget the grass,” said Poke glibly. “It won’t
do to waste yourself on—on domestic duties,
Hazard; you look to me just like a chap who
has the making of a good back in him. Say,
now, you come out to-morrow afternoon with us
and we’ll hand you over to Johnny and see what
happens. Will you?”</p>

<p>But Jim shook his head, with a smile. “I
know what might happen,” he said. “There
might be no coal to cook supper with.”</p>

<p>“Get a fireless cooker,” suggested Jeffrey
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Joking aside, Hazard,” said Gil soberly,
“they really need you on the field this fall.
We’re short of good men. See if you can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
fix your chores so as to have the afternoons
for football.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think they can do without me,”
laughed Jim. “If they ever saw me play they
wouldn’t want me a minute. No, I guess I’ll
get my exercise right around here.”</p>

<p>“Let me go as his substitute,” said Jeffrey
with a smile.</p>

<p>“At that you’d get around a heap quicker
than some of the fellows who try for the team,”
replied Poke. “Well, let’s wash up, Gil. It’s
meeting night, you remember.”</p>

<p>“What’s meeting night?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“Plato Society meets this evening. I’d ask
you along, but it’s business meeting to-night.
Glad to have you some other time, though;
you, too, Latham, if you’d like.”</p>

<p>At supper the household had increased to
seven, for Mr. Hanks occupied the seat of honor
at Mrs. Hazard’s right. He was introduced
to the boys and shook hands with each, smiling
in his absentminded way. At first his presence
at table rather dampened the spirits of the
others, excepting Mrs. Hazard who did her best
to make conversation with the newcomer. Her
efforts, however, were not very successful. Mr.
Hanks replied politely but embarrassedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
showing that he was far more ill at ease than
the boys. On the whole, supper was a quiet
meal, and almost as soon as it was over Gil
and Poke left the house for the meeting.</p>

<p>At Crofton the faculty keeps a gentle but
firm hold on the societies by assigning to each
a Counsellor, one of the younger faculty members.
He is responsible to the Principal for the
conduct of his society, although his office is
merely an advisory one. Plato’s Counsellor
was Mr. Brown, better known as “Brownie,”
instructor in Greek and one of the more popular
of the faculty members. Plato, like the other
three societies, had a home of its own, a small
cottage near the campus on Academy Road in
charge of an elderly man and his wife who received
the rear part of the house rent-free in
return for their services as housekeeper and
gardener. There was a little yard in front,
what Poke called an “open-faced porch”—there
being no railing on it—and four downstairs
rooms, of which two were used by the
society. On the second floor were four bedrooms,
occupied principally by visiting friends.
The room on the right on the first floor was the
Meeting Room, and it was quite ample in size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to accommodate the thirty boys who had congregated
there this evening.</p>

<p>It was already well filled when Gil and Poke
arrived, although the meeting had not yet been
called to order. Mr. Brown was the center
of a group of fellows which the two new arrivals
joined. The instructor had a handshake
and a word of welcome for each. Then other
friends demanded recognition, and for the next
five minutes the hum of talk and laughter filled
the square, old-fashioned room. The two windows
on the front of the house were wide open,
for the flaring gas-jets in the big chandelier
were making the room uncomfortably warm.
The side windows were kept closed and curtained,
for it was not beyond the possibilities
that prankish or curious members of a rival society
might eavesdrop; such a thing had occurred
before now, and the heavy shrubbery outside
offered excellent concealment for the enemy.
The room was papered with plain gray cartridge
paper above the white-painted paneling,
and a half-dozen good engravings decorated
the walls. There was an oak desk between the
front windows with a few straight-backed chairs
about it, while some forty folding chairs filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the body of the room. There was no carpet
on the floor and the broad mantel was bare of
adornment. The apartment, save at commencement
time, was used only for business purposes.
At commencement the chairs were
moved against the wall and visiting relatives
and friends took possession and the floor was
waxed for dancing.</p>

<p>Presently the president of the Society, Ben
Atherton, who was also captain of the crew,
rapped on the desk with a little silver-mounted
gavel and the fellows took their places. What
passed at the meeting we, as outsiders, have
no right to know. I do not believe, however,
that it was a very important affair, for it lasted
less than half an hour. Then the boys trooped
into the room across the hall or emerged onto
the porch. Banjos, mandolins and guitars
were taken from their cases. “Punk” Gibbs
seated himself at the piano—a long-suffering
instrument constantly in need of tuning—and
wandered through some chords while the other
musicians, seated around or leaning about it,
tuned up.</p>

<p>The Social Room, as they called it, was well
and comfortably furnished. There were many
brown oak chairs and settles upholstered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dull red leather, some fairly good rugs on the
polished floor, a broad couch, filled with cushions—and,
just now, with boys as well—in
front of the fireplace, a good-sized bookcase
moderately well filled and many pictures on the
walls. The word picture here means all sorts
of things in frames, for there were originals
of cover-designs for the school weekly, <cite>The
Crow</cite>, posters of all sorts, drawings and other
trophies and mementos, all crowded together
in interesting confusion. Visitors to Plato Society
found the walls of the Social Room highly
amusing.</p>

<p>The room was soon noisy with talk and
laughter, the jangle of the piano and the <em>strum-strum</em>
of strings. Gil and Poke had found
places at one of the windows, which opened
clear to the floor, where, seated on cushions,
they were in position to see and hear what
went on both inside and out. Mr. Brown was
on the porch telling an interested group about
his summer walking trip through Switzerland.
On the big couch in front of the empty fireplace
a very hilarious group were recounting
their own vacation experiences and, incidentally,
“rubbing it into” one youth on whom
they apparently had a very good joke. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
grinning in an embarrassed way and half-heartedly
retaliating on his chief tormentor with
a cushion. Then Gibbs started up “Old
Plato” and the banjos and guitars and mandolins,
six or seven in all, joined in as best they
could. Fingers were stiff, however, from lack
of practice, and the music was pretty wobbly
at first. But by the time Gibbs had reached
the refrain the orchestra was doing fairly well,
and when the pianist started over again, first
one voice and then another began the words,
and presently the whole assemblage was singing
the Society Song. It wasn’t an especially
edifying production, but it went with a swing
and Platonians had sung it for years.</p>

<p>Afterwards they sang “Crow, Crow for
Crofton!” and then “Follow the River”:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Follow the river up from the sea,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Then came the old college songs, “Mother
Yale,” “Fair Harvard,” “Old Nassau,” and
the football songs, “Boola,” “Veritas,” and
many more. And then it was bedtime—Mr.
Brown was the first to discover the fact—and
instruments were put away, the lights extinguished
and by twos and threes and larger
groups the Platonians dispersed. The Counsellor
lived in Browne Hall—most appropriately—and
as Browne was the last dormitory
on the campus the instructor was accompanied
homeward by some dozen or more students. Gil
and Poke were amongst the number, for it was
quite as near for them to walk to the school
and then go home through the woods as to follow
the winding road. Besides, there was a full
moon to-night to light their way.</p>

<p>They talked about the new students and speculated
as to whom they would draw into Plato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
when the elections came. This was a subject
of unfailing interest, although it was too early
in the school year for the interest to wax intense.
The societies took their members from
the three upper classes in January and each
sought to select fellows who had in some way
distinguished themselves.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing,” said Mr. Brown, as
they passed into the black shadows of Academy
Hall, “that we ought to keep in sight, fellows,
and that is that the men we want for Plato are
the men who have not only <em>done</em> things but who
<em>think</em> things. Don’t let’s just make the Society
a group of athletes and First Honors men and
commencement officers. Let’s try and pick the
fellows who are honorable and earnest and fine
and manly. Remember that Plato isn’t over
with when you leave Crofton; the Society goes
right on, bringing other fellows together just
as it has brought us together. Let’s see that
when we leave it we leave it in shape to do the
work it was designed to do, let’s see that we
leave a fine, big lot of chaps to carry on the
work in our stead. It’s character we want, fellows,
and not merely athletic honors, nor social
honors, nor even merely scholastic honors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Let’s judge our members to be as <em>men</em> first;
then consider the honors they’ve won. Remember
the motto, fellows: ‘For the Good of the
School, and so for the Good of Myself.’ Good
night, everybody.”</p>

<small>JIM MAKES A PROMISE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“We’ve got the same lessons, Hazard,”
said Jeffrey, after the others had taken
their departure, “so why don’t you bring your
books into my room and study?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to,” answered Jim, “and I will as
soon as I finish my chores.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later the two were seated on
opposite sides of the table in Jeff’s room, their
books spread out before them in a very businesslike
way. But there wasn’t much studying
done that evening, although each acknowledged
the necessity of it. There were too many things
to talk about. Naturally the foremost topic
was the school. Jeffrey had to tell Jim what
he thought about it, and Jim had to give his
opinion of the fellows they had met; and after
that they discussed the instructors and the
course of study and many associated subjects.
And before the evening was over it was no
longer Hazard and Latham, but Jim and Jeff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>And in another day or two proper names had
quite disappeared from Sunnywood. Every
one called every one else by his first name; except
that Poke had dubbed Jeff “The Senator”
and called him that about half the time. For
awhile Jim’s mother was “Mrs. Hazard,” but
eventually she became “Lady” to every one
except Mr. Hanks. Mr. Hanks—or “Nancy,”
as the boys dubbed him—called Mrs. Hazard
pretty nearly everything except Mrs. Hazard.
Sometimes it was Hazel, sometimes Hastings,
sometimes Hathaway; and once, to the amusement
and bewilderment of the entire table, he
called her “Mrs. Venture.” Hope was “Miss
Hope” to the boys for awhile, but as friendship
ripened the Miss was dropped. The boys all
liked Hope. They couldn’t have done anything
else, I fancy, for Hope was always happy and
merry, eager for fun and firmly convinced that
Sunnywood Cottage held the four finest boys in
Crofton Academy.</p>

<p>But I am getting ahead of my story.</p>

<p>Gil and Poke had in due time received the
required parental sanction to their change of
quarters and had settled down very comfortably
in what Poke called the Royal Suite. With
three of their rooms rented for the school year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Jim and his mother were much encouraged, for
even if the fourth room didn’t rent they could,
they were certain, more than pay expenses. Mr.
Hanks, in spite of Poke’s forebodings, troubled
no one. If he found the house rather noisy
at times, he made no complaint. Except at
meal times they saw very little of him. He was
usually very silent at the table, accepting what
was placed before him or handed to him and
eating it in his funny absentminded way. At
school, however, Mr. Hanks was having his troubles.
In the first place, he was a new man, and
there is an unwritten law at Crofton to the effect
that new instructors must be decently hazed.
Hazing in Mr. Hanks’ case consisted of taking
advantage of his inexperience and diffidence
until at the end of his first week at school his
Latin and history classes had lost all semblance
of order and discipline. The instructor’s worst
trial was Latin 2. In this class was Brandon
Gary, and Gary knew more ways to make the
teacher’s life a burden to him than there were
pages in the Æneid.</p>

<p>“Bull makes me very tired,” said Gil one day.
“It’s all right to have a little fun; and every
faculty ought to stand a little joshing; but Bull
is keeping it up too long. First thing we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Nancy will get discouraged and quit. If he
only knew enough to sit on a few of those Smart
Alecks he wouldn’t have any more trouble.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s just as mean as can be,” declared
Hope. “Mr. Hanks is a perfect dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s all right,” agreed Poke. “Nancy
isn’t a half bad sort. Only thing is he hasn’t
enough grit.”</p>

<p>“And,” continued Hope, puzzledly, “I don’t
see why you want to call him Nancy. He
doesn’t look a bit like a horse.”</p>

<p>“A what?” demanded Jeff in surprise.</p>

<p>“A horse. I asked Lady the other day who
Nancy Hanks was and she said he—I mean she—was
a famous racehorse. And I don’t see—”</p>

<p>But the boys were laughing so loudly that the
rest of Hope’s remark was drowned. She
viewed them bewilderedly.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t she a horse?” she asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Jeff, who had recovered
first, “I believe there used to be a horse named
that. But the original Nancy Hanks was Abraham
Lincoln’s mother. Have you never heard
of her?”</p>

<p>Hope shook her head. “I don’t believe so.
What—what did she do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Jeff looked at Gil and Gil looked at Jim and
Jim shook his head. It was Poke who came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hanks,” he observed thoughtfully,
“was a very estimable lady. Besides being
the mother of the Martyr President she—er—she
invented the idea of winding yarn in
hanks. Hence the name.”</p>

<p>The others viewed him suspiciously, but were
afraid to question his statement for fear of confessing
their ignorance. Jeff said “Hm” noncommittingly
and Jim became very busy over
the lock he was trying to repair. Hope accepted
the information at face value and thanked
Poke very nicely. Poke, I think, was on the
verge of a confession when Mr. Hanks himself
came into sight beyond the fence. He had an
armful of books as usual and his head seemed
to have acquired to-day an added droop. As
he turned in through the gate his face looked
pretty tired and discouraged. Jim and Poke
arose from their places on the steps to let him
by and it was only then that he saw the group.
He lifted his funny old straw hat rather sketchily
and murmured, “Good evening.” The
others responded politely, but Hope, with a
sudden rush of sympathy for the instructor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
said: “Won’t you sit down here and rest, Mr.
Hanks? You look very tired, and supper won’t
be ready for a long time.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks looked surprised and embarrassed,
hesitated, dropped a book—which Gil rescued—and
finally stammered: “Er—thanks, but
I have much work to do. It—it has been a
very nice day, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>They all agreed enthusiastically that it had,
after which Mr. Hanks hemmed and coughed
once or twice, bowed jerkily and went on in.
They could hear him walking weariedly up the
stairs to his room.</p>

<p>“He looks perfectly floppy!” exclaimed
Hope, indignantly. “It is too mean for anything
to treat him so!”</p>

<p>“What’s floppy?” asked Gil, a little ashamed
of his own small share in the instructor’s unhappiness
and willing to switch the conversation.</p>

<p>“Why—why, <em>floppy</em>, of course; tired and—and
miserable and unhappy!”</p>

<p>“Ready to flop,” added Poke knowingly.
“It is an excellent word, even if Mr. Webster
doesn’t countenance it. What’s the matter,
Jim?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“I lost a screw somewhere. I guess it went
down a crack when I got up.”</p>

<p>“That lock will be a wonder when you get
through with it,” laughed Poke. “You’ve
used up three screw-drivers and a perfectly
good penknife on it so far.”</p>

<p>“The trouble,” responded Jim gravely, holding
the offending article under his nose and
squinting knowingly into its intricacies, “is
with the tumblers.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Poke. “The trouble’s in
the carburetor. It needs adjusting. How’s
school going, Hope?”</p>

<p>“Fine!—I just love the teacher in our
room.”</p>

<p>“Hm; wait until you’ve been there another
week. Teachers all look good at first. They’re
very—very deceptive.” Poke shook his head
sadly. “I’ve had a great deal of experience
with teachers.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve had a good deal of experience
with you,” laughed Hope. Poke grinned.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t deny that I have aided in the
education of a few. Including our estimable
Nancy,” he added rashly.</p>

<p>Hope sobered. “I shan’t like you, Poke,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
she said gravely, “if you’re mean to Mr.
Hanks.”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? Honest, now, I haven’t done
a thing, have I, Gil?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” answered Gil. “No more
than I have. We’ve all had a go at him. I
think, though, it’s about time we let up. I guess
we’ll have to squelch Bull Gary, Poke.”</p>

<p>Poke nodded. “I guess so. Bull lacks a—a
sense of sufficiency.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Jeff.</p>

<p>“That is a polite way of saying that he
doesn’t know when he’s had enough. By the
way, Jim, did we tell you that Gary has taken
a room at Jones’s? He says it’s fine, but that’s
poppycock. Jones’s is the worst hole in the
village. I guess he’s still peeved with you for
not renting a room to him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I could,” said Jim, laying
aside the lock with a sigh of relief. “I wasn’t
going to put Jeff out; or you fellows either.
Besides, I don’t like him.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bull isn’t terribly popular,” said
Gil, “but he’s really not so awfully bad. All
he needs is some one to beat a little sense into
him. He’s a lot better than when he first came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
I dare say that some day Gary will be a useful
member of society.”</p>

<p>“In the sweet by and by,” said Poke skeptically.
“And, say, Gil, what’s the matter
with Bull’s playing this year? He’s way off
his game. Johnny gave him a fierce ragging
this afternoon. Did you hear him? Told Bull
that if he didn’t do better than he’d been doing
he’d be wearing a nice warm blanket on the
side-line. I guess Bull has a swelled head after
last year.”</p>

<p>“Does he play well?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“He <em>can</em> play well. He’s one of the best
guards we’ve had for years. And in the Hawthorne
game last fall—which, as you probably
know, Mr. Locksmith, is our big game—he put
up a grand old exhibition. Didn’t he, Gil?”</p>

<p>“You bet! And that’s what I say. You
can’t altogether dislike a chap who can play
football the way he can—when he wants to.”</p>

<p>“Well, he will have to want to pretty soon,
I guess,” said Poke. “Johnny’s getting out
of patience. When are you coming down to the
field with me, Jim, to have a try?”</p>

<p>“About Christmas time, I think.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say? Well, let me tell you something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
son. I’m going to get Dun Sargent after
you. I’m not going to see a good football
player wasted in a locksmith.”</p>

<p>“Good football player!” scoffed Jim. “I
never played enough to be good—or even real
bad, for that matter. I don’t know enough
about the rules to—to—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Gil. “They’ll
teach the rules to you. Just you come and have
a try. You’re missing a lot of fun.”</p>

<p>“And a lot of hard work, too,” sighed Poke.</p>

<p>“I wish you would play,” said Hope.
“Won’t you, Jim?”</p>

<p>“How can I?” asked Jim a trifle irritably.
“I’d like to—in a way—I guess, but who’d
do the work here?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Poke impressively, “if you’ll
try for the squad and if you make it we’ll all
help with your silly chores. Won’t we, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Right-O!” agreed Gil.</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Poke continued, “what do you
have to do, anyway? Lug up a little coal, split
some kindling, sift some ashes—”</p>

<p>“Beat some carpets, run some errands, fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
some locks, study some lessons,” added Jim
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s nothing,” said Poke airily.
“I’m a wonderful carpet beater; better than
one of those vacuum things, Jim. Now that’s
a fair offer. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Jim laughed.</p>

<p>“Will you report to-morrow?” Poke persisted.</p>

<p>“No, but maybe I’ll go down and look on for
awhile.”</p>

<p>“All right! That’s a promise. You go
down with Gil and me after school to-morrow.
Don’t forget. Jeff, you’re a witness; you too,
Hope. After he’s looked on awhile he will want
to play. Jim, you’re a gone coon!”</p>

<small>POKE USES TACT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jim kept his promise; in fact, he was given
no choice in the matter, for Poke was waiting
for him on the steps of Academy Hall when
he emerged from his algebra recitation the next
afternoon. Jeffrey had agreed to accompany
them to the field, but as he didn’t show up they
started along without him. It was Jim’s first
visit to the field, although he had often viewed
it from afar. Their way took them past the
front of Memorial Hall, a small building of
Grecian architecture presented to the school by
graduates in honor of four Croftonians who
had lost their lives in the war with Spain.
Crofton was proud of those men and the bronze
tablet beside the doorway was one of the first
objects exhibited to visitors. The building held
the dining-hall and kitchen, and if some humorists
alluded to it as Prunorial Hall no disrespect
was intended.</p>

<p>The river, a few rods away, was alive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
craft this afternoon, for this early October day
was warm and still, with just enough hint of
autumn in the air to make the blood course
quickly and put the joy of adventure in the
heart. Half way between Memorial and the
gymnasium the two boys turned at the sound
of a hail from the river. In a canoe sat Jeffrey
and Gil, the latter snuggled comfortably in the
bow and the former dexterously dipping the
paddle in the stern. Gil waved his hand nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” cried Poke enviously.
“Do you know what time it is?”</p>

<p>“I am the Queen of Sheba,” replied Gil,
“and this is my royal barge. We are on the
way to the gym.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the lazy Its!” exclaimed Poke.
“Say, Senator, take me back after practice?”</p>

<p>Gil howled derisively. “Get out! I’ve engaged
Jeff for the rest of the day. Proceed,
slave!”</p>

<p>Jeffrey, smiling broadly, dipped his paddle
again and the canoe went on along the stream
to the swimming float. The others walked down
to meet them.</p>

<p>“We’ve had a dandy ride,” said Gil as he
stretched the kinks out of his legs. “Jeff took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
me all the way up to Birch Island and back.
He’s a fine little canoedler.” Jeff, once more
with his crutches under his arms, fell in beside
Jim.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll get a canoe of my own,” he said.
“They say there’s a fellow up the river a couple
of miles who makes dandy ones. And I’m
sort of daffy about being on the water.”</p>

<p>“Is it hard to learn to paddle one of those
things?” Jim asked. “I tried it once and the
silly thing just went around in a circle and made
me dizzy.”</p>

<p>“It’s the easiest thing there is,” laughed
Jeffrey. “You come out with me some day
and I’ll show you the trick in a minute.”</p>

<p>Gil and Poke disappeared in the gym to don
their football clothes and the others sauntered
slowly toward the field. Already the big expanse
of yellowing turf was scattered with
players. Beyond the gridiron with its new
white lines a baseball game had begun. Nearer
at hand the tennis courts were all occupied.
And on the grand-stand and along the sides of
the field on the warm grass fellows less inclined
to bodily exertion sat or sprawled in groups
and waited to be entertained. Half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pigskins were arching back and forth across the
gridiron or bounding erratically into the spectators.
Jim and Jeff found a place near the
twenty-five-yard line and settled themselves,
Jeff laying his crutches down with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“This is fine,” he murmured as he lay back
with his hands beneath his head and blinked at
the sunlight. “I read somewhere once, Jim,
that every one has the—the characteristics of
some animal. I guess I’m like a cat, I’m so
fond of sunlight and warmth. I could almost
purr this minute.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” Jim laughed. “I don’t mind
as long as you don’t scratch. There comes
What’s-his-name, the coach.”</p>

<p>“Connell,” murmured Jeffrey. “They say
he’s a dandy.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t very big,” replied Jim doubtfully.
“He doesn’t look much taller than I. Guess
he’s the sort to make you stand around,
though; don’t believe he’d take much nonsense.
There’s Gil and Duncan Sargent. And there’s
that chap Gary, the fellow who wanted your
room. He’s pretty hefty, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Jeffrey rolled over and observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the scene, supported on one elbow. “I heard
a fellow say Gary had a grouch against Connell
and isn’t half playing.”</p>

<p>“Johnny” shouted to the candidates and
they came from all quarters of the field and
flocked about him. There seemed to be some
fifty or sixty of them altogether.</p>

<p>“A lot of show I’d have,” said Jim, “in that
bunch. Some of those chaps must be nineteen
years old.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” Jeffrey replied. “But that
doesn’t necessarily mean much. You are going
to try, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Jim shrugged his shoulders. “I’d sort of
like to,” he acknowledged, “but I’d just make
a show of myself, I guess.”</p>

<p>The coach had finished his instructions and
now the candidates were forming in groups
about the field. For the beginners football was
still drudgery; passing, falling on the ball,
starting and tackling. But the veterans were
learning signals and getting ready for the first
game now only three days distant. The first
and second squads were soon scampering up and
down the field in short rushes under the directions
of shrill-voiced quarter-backs. In Squad
A a substitute had Duncan Sargent’s place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
left guard and the captain, draped in a faded
red blanket that trailed behind him and tried
to trip him up in moments of excitement, followed
the play. Now and then Jim could
hear him calling a halt and laying down the
law.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Let’s try that again. And don’t
go to sleep, Smith, this time. They’d have got
you about three yards behind your line then.
Take your time from quarter. This is a delayed
pass, but not a misplaced one. And now
try again. Same signals, Arnold.”</p>

<p>On this first squad Gil was at left end, Poke
at right half-back and Gary at right guard.
To Jim’s surprise the fellows were not very
heavy in weight, while as to age the squad would
have averaged about seventeen. The quarter,
Harry Arnold, was a mere youngster, and with
the exception of Captain Sargent himself there
was no member over eighteen. LaGrange, a
big good-natured youth who played center, was
but sixteen, in spite of his size.</p>

<p>Jim and Jeffrey looked on with interest.
Jeffrey, who had made other trips to the field,
knew many of the more prominent players by
name and pointed them out to his companion.
At the end of half an hour the signal work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
ceased, the linemen were taken to the upper end
of the field for special instruction and the backs
and ends were put to work getting down under
kicks. As it happened Poke took up his position
at a little distance from Jim and Jeffrey,
and, turning to run back for a long catch, caught
sight of them.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he shouted. “Seen Sargent,
Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. Poke curled the ball
against his arm and hurled it back across the
field.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s looking for you. I told him you
wanted to come out for the team. Told him you
were a wonderful footballist, Jim, and he’s hot
on your trail.”</p>

<p>“You told him that?” cried Jim in dismay.
“Why, you—you—”</p>

<p>“Say it,” said Poke, keeping a watchful eye
across the field at where a substitute center was
poising the ball between his legs. Jim grinned
ruefully and threw a pebble at him.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t tell him any such yarn as
that, did you, Poke?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I told him you were thinking of coming out,
Jim, and that you’d played the game some.
Said you looked good to me. When he asks you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
just keep your mouth shut tight and it will be
all right.”</p>

<p>With that Poke sprinted for the arching pigskin,
caught it deftly without slackening his
speed and dodged the opposing end.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he did tell Sargent all
that?” Jim said.</p>

<p>“I dare say,” replied Jeffrey with a smile.
“Poke is likely to say most anything he thinks
of. I guess you’ll soon know, though, for
there’s Sargent now.”</p>

<p>The captain, having discarded his blanket,
was striding across the field toward Poke.
They exchanged a few words and Poke nodded
his head toward Jim and Jeffrey. In a moment
Duncan Sargent had reached them.</p>

<p>“How are you, Hazard?” he began. “Endicott
tells me you’ve decided to help us out,
and I’m mighty glad to hear it. We really want
fellows who know something about the game
and are willing to buckle down to it. Wish you
might have come out to-day. To-morrow sure,
though, eh?”</p>

<p>Jim, who had climbed to his feet, looked somewhat
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Why—er—I only told Endicott that I
might like to try—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course! That’s the spirit! You’ve
played a good bit, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, not much,” answered Jim modestly.
“I really don’t—”</p>

<p>“In the line, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, when I played, but I never—”</p>

<p>“Fine! We need linemen, Hazard. You report
to me to-morrow and I’ll put you to work.
There’s going to be a cut in a day or two and
then we’ll have some of these dubs out of the
way. Don’t forget! Three-thirty!”</p>

<p>And away hurried Sargent, leaving Jim
flushed and uncomfortable and Jeffrey visibly
amused.</p>

<p>“Now what shall I do?” asked Jim ruefully.
“He evidently thinks I’m a regular Hogan of
a lineman. I wonder what Poke <em>did</em> tell him!
Why, hang it, Jeff, I don’t even know this year’s
rules!”</p>

<p>“Oh, they aren’t much different from last
year,” replied Jeffrey consolingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are; they’re different every season.
Every time any one thinks of a new wrinkle
he writes to the Rules Committee about it
and they stick it in. Well, you won’t see me
around here to-morrow! It’s me for the tall
timber!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, shucks, Jim, see it through. You can
tell Sargent you aren’t a star—”</p>

<p>“Tell him! Why, didn’t I try to tell him?”
exclaimed Jim irritably. “He wouldn’t let me
get a word in edgewise.”</p>

<p>“He was afraid you would try to beg off,”
laughed Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“He didn’t give me a chance,” replied Jim
ruefully. “Guess I’ll just have to hike out to
the woods or he will get me sure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d do that. See it through.
You’ll like it after you get started. Why, the
first game’s on Saturday. Maybe Sargent will
put you in in his place, Jim!”</p>

<p>“Dry up. They’re going to scrimmage.
Let’s get nearer the middle of the field.”</p>

<p>The scrimmage wasn’t very encouraging that
day. There was a good deal more fumbling
than there should have been and it was plain
to be seen that neither first nor second team had
thoroughly learned its signals. When it was
over Jim and Jeff cut across the field and took
the road back to Sunnywood.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Jim as they passed the
little white house where Plato Society held its
meetings, “if being on the football team would
help a fellow to make a society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” answered Jeffrey, “I suppose a fellow
who is well known and has done something
for the school like playing football or baseball
or rowing in the boat naturally stands a better
show than some chap who is unknown.”</p>

<p>He shot a glance at Jim’s thoughtful face and
smiled to himself. A hundred yards further
on Jim spoke again.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said, “if Gil or Poke has a
book of rules.”</p>

<p>When Poke came back he sought Jim and
found him in the cellar swinging the ax.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said, “what are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Kindlings,” replied Jim as he dodged a
piece of wood. Then he buried the ax in the
block and faced Poke.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p125">“Look here,” he demanded, “what did you
tell Duncan Sargent about me?”</a></p>

<p>Poke laughed. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because he evidently thinks I’m a football
player and he wouldn’t give me a chance to say
anything at all; just rattled on and on and fixed
it all up that I’m to report for practice to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Did he? Well, I told you you’d be a gone
coon if you once got out on the field.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126-<br />127]</a></span></p>

<p>“What did you tell him?” Jim insisted
sternly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just that you’d played the game and
that I had an idea you’d be a big addition to
the team. It wasn’t what I really said so much
as the—the impression I managed to convey,
Jim. One thing I rather dwelt on,” he continued
with a chuckle, “was that you were terribly
modest and that you were almost certain
to refuse to come out for the team if he gave
you a chance.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well”—Jim shrugged his shoulders—“he
will be considerably surprised to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, that will be all right. You’ll pick
it up quick enough, and before the season’s over
you’ll be thanking me on your knees for my—er—diplomacy.”</p>

<p>“Your fibs, you mean! Look here, Poke, I
don’t even know what the rules are this year.”</p>

<p>“No more does any one—except Johnny;
and I sometimes think he’s just bluffing. You
come up to the room after supper and Gil and
I will tell you all you need to know. Between
us I dare say we’ve got a fair inkling of the
rules.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” Jim agreed. “But I’m going
to see Sargent to-morrow before practice and
tell him the facts. I’m not going to start out
under false colors.”</p>

<p>“Hm.” Poke considered that a moment.
“Oh, all right. The main thing is to come out.
Got any togs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some old ones. I guess they’ll do.
Guess they’ll have to. I can’t afford to buy new
ones.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff! Get ’em out and we’ll look ’em
over. Here, I’ll take that up for you. You
bring the coal. You know we all agreed to help
out with the chores if you went in for the team.”</p>

<small>OUT FOR THE TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hope was delighted.</p>

<p>“I just know you’re going to be a real
football hero, Jim,” she declared earnestly.
“And I shall be too proud of you for words!
And to-morrow I shall go and see you play.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” responded
Jim shortly. “If I’ve got to make a fool of
myself I don’t intend to have the whole family
watching me.”</p>

<p>Hope’s face fell. “But I may see you some
day, mayn’t I? And I shall bring some of the
girls from school with me. There’s one, Grace
Andrews, whose brother plays on the High
School team and she’s too sticky about it for
anything. We play the High School Saturday,
don’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do hope they’ll let you play then, Jim!
I’d love to have Grace Andrews see you.”</p>

<p>“Well, she won’t,” replied Jim grimly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“I’ll be on the awkward squad for weeks, I suppose,
and it’s a fair bet I never leave it. Besides,
it seems to me your sympathy ought to
be with your own school, sis.”</p>

<p>Hope considered that a moment. Then,
“Well,” she sighed, “it’s a very difficult position
I’m in. Of course I’m very fond of High
School, Jim, but—but I think I’d rather have
Crofton win; especially if you play. Wouldn’t
that be just perfectly jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Fine! And maybe Duncan Sargent will retire
and make me captain in his place,” added
Jim ironically as he started upstairs to get
ready for supper. “But, somehow, I don’t
look for him to do it!”</p>

<p>After supper study was delayed in Sunnywood
while Gil and Poke went over the football
rules with Jim and did their best to elucidate
them. Jeffrey was on hand too, and if it had
not been for him I think Jim would have known
less after the lesson than before, for Gil and
Poke proved quite at variance as to the interpretation
of half the rules and Jim was getting
more and more confused when Jeffrey came to
the rescue. Gil and Poke were hotly contradicting
each other as to what invalidated a forward
pass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to Jeff if I’m not right,” declared
Poke.</p>

<p>“Whereupon Jeffrey very quietly and understandingly
explained Rule XIX in all its phases,
while the others listened in respectful and admiring
silence.</p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed Poke when Jeffrey had
finished, “you certainly know the rules, Senator.
I’ll bet you you wrote them yourself!”</p>

<p>Jeffrey smilingly denied this but acknowledged
that he always studied them very carefully
each year, adding, “You see, I like to
watch football mighty well, even if I can’t play
it, and unless you know the rules of the game
well enough to know just what’s being done all
the time, and why, you don’t thoroughly enjoy
it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Gil, “I guess you know them
better than most of the fellows who play. I believe
I’ll get a rule book and study up a little
myself.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t understand them,” said Poke.
“It takes a chap with a whole lot of brains to
make head or tails of that stuff. Why, bless
you, fellows, I was looking through a book of
rules before I left home. Give you my word I
tried the hardest I knew how to make out what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it was all about, and could I? I could—<em>not</em>!
So I pitched the silly book in the waste-basket.
And I wouldn’t be at all surprised to hear that
the ashman found it and has gone crazy.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s about all you need to know at
first, Jim,” said Gil. “You’ll pick it up quick
enough. The main thing is to know how to hold
a ball so it won’t bite you, to kick a little, throw
a little—”</p>

<p>“Won’t need to know that if he plays in the
line,” said Poke. “If he can block and break
through and help the runner—”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ve had enough for to-night,”
said Jim. “I guess I’d better pay a little attention
to my lessons. Looked at your Latin
yet, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been over it once; it looks pretty
easy.”</p>

<p>“For you perhaps,” replied Jim. “It won’t
be for me, though.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of Latin,” said Gil, “something’s
due to happen to Nancy Hanks pretty soon if
he doesn’t brace up. They say J. G. is getting
very much peeved at him. There was a peach
of a rough house in history this morning,
wasn’t there, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Lovely! But I’m sorry for Nancy, just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
same. Bull Gary makes me tired. He’s got
half a dozen of the fellows trained now so that
every time he starts something they all drop
into line and poor Nancy’s life is a positive burden
to him.”</p>

<p>“He shows it, too,” observed Jeffrey.
“He’s getting to look as worried and nervous
as—as a wet hen.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Jim. “We’ve sort of let
up on him in our classes. The fun wore off
after awhile.”</p>

<p>“Because you haven’t any one in your bunch
with the inventive genius of Mr. Gary,” said
Poke. “Bull lies awake nights, I guess, thinking
up new mischief. Somebody will just have
to sit on him, Gil, and sit hard.”</p>

<p>“Yes, maybe. Still, perhaps, after all, Crofton
isn’t just the place for Nancy. And if it
isn’t he might as well make the discovery now
as later. I guess he knows an awful lot, but I
don’t believe he can teach it. And as for discipline,
why, he doesn’t know the meaning of
the word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he knows what it means all right,” corrected
Poke, “but he doesn’t know how to go
to work to enforce it. I’ll bet you he never
taught before in his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then what’s he been doing all these
years?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“I think,” replied Jeffrey, “that he writes.”</p>

<p>“Writes? Writes what?” asked Poke.</p>

<p>“Books. The other day I passed his room
when he happened to have left the door open—which
doesn’t very often happen, as you know—and
I saw a whole pile of paper on his desk
and he was writing away like sixty with those
tortoise-shell spectacles of his on.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Correcting papers, likely,” said
Poke.</p>

<p>“They weren’t papers; they were sheets all
written on just alike. I could see that easily.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what sort of books he writes,” murmured
Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, about Latin and history, probably,”
said Poke. “Maybe they’re text-books. He
doesn’t look quite such a criminal as that,
either.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever he writes,” remarked Gil,
“it’s a safe bet he won’t be doing it here much
longer.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we do something?” asked Jeffrey.
“You see, after all, even if he is a member of
the faculty, he—he’s one of us, you know, a
Sunnywooder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Poke, “and we ought to
stick together. I guess we’ll just have to read
the riot act to Bull, Gil.”</p>

<p>Gil half-heartedly replied that he guessed
something like that would have to be done and
the conclave broke up, Jeffrey and Jim retiring
across the hall to the former’s room in which
Jim had formed the custom of studying.</p>

<p>The next afternoon he accompanied Gil and
Poke to the gymnasium, rented a locker and
struggled into his football togs which had grown
strangely tight in the last year. Then, in the
wake of half a hundred other fellows, they trotted
down to the field and Jim sought Duncan
Sargent. He found him conferring with Johnny
and waited a few steps away until they finished
talking. As it happened captain and coach were
not telling secrets and so made no effort to talk
quietly, and before Jim realized it he heard Sargent
say:</p>

<p>“By the way, Johnny, I’ve got a new lineman
coming out this afternoon; fellow named
Hazard; big and rangy and looks good. Poke
Endicott knows him and says he’s an all right
player. I’ll hand him over to you and you give
him a try with the second squad in scrimmage,
will you? Let me know how he shapes up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s good,” replied Johnny with enthusiasm.
“We surely need better line material
than we’ve got. There isn’t a promising substitute
tackle in sight. Send him along to me and
I’ll see what he can do.”</p>

<p>They strolled slowly away, still talking, leaving
Jim a prey to varied emotions. He wanted
to punch Poke for getting him into such a scrape.
How could he go to Sargent now and say that it
was all a mistake, that he really knew very little
about the game and had only played as a sort
of third or fourth substitute on his grammar
school eleven? Why, it couldn’t be done!
Rather than do that he would sneak back to the
gymnasium, get his togs off and go home. He
thought hard for a minute, while he followed the
captain and trainer across the field. After all,
he reflected presently, perhaps he could play
fairly well if he had a chance. Why not accept
the reputation that had been imposed upon him
without his connivance and carry things off as
best he could? After all, it wasn’t his fault, and
if he disappointed them, why, he could get out.
The situation required nerve and Jim had plenty
of it when necessary. He smiled and made up
his mind. They thought him an experienced
player. Well, he would do his best to keep up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the delusion. Let them find out for themselves
that he was little more than a tyro, a one-hundred-and-thirty-pound
bluff in a suit that threatened
to rip at the seams every time he stretched
his muscles!</p>

<p>He quickened his gait and overtook Duncan
Sargent.</p>

<p>“What shall I do, Captain?” he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>“Eh? Hello, Hazard.” Sargent was so
pleased that he shook hands and Jim’s conscience
smote him for an instant. Sargent was
such a dandy chap that it seemed a shame to
impose on him. “Hi, Johnny! Here a minute,
please.” And as the trainer came swinging up,
Sargent continued: “This is Hazard. You
know I spoke to you about him. Take him in
hand, will you, Johnny?”</p>

<p>Johnny said he was glad to meet Mr. Hazard
and shook hands with a grip that made Jim
wince.</p>

<p>“Play in the line, don’t you?” he asked.
“That’s good; we need linemen. This is your
first practice?”</p>

<p>Jim agreed that it was.</p>

<p>“Then I guess we’ll go easy with you. Suppose
you go over there and report to Gary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
tell him I sent you. Pass the ball awhile and
warm up.” He took out a little tattered memorandum
book and entered Jim, name, age and
address. “Come to me after practice, Hazard,
and I’ll put you on the scales. About a hundred
and thirty, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t weighed very recently,” replied
Jim, “but I guess that’s pretty near it.”</p>

<p>“All right. By the way, ever play tackle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for awhile; and guard. And I was at
full-back once or twice.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look very quick on your feet,”
commented Johnny, “but we’ll get you gingered
up after awhile. Don’t be afraid of sweating a
little; it will do you good.”</p>

<p>Jim obediently made his way down the field
to the squad indicated, and Johnny and Sargent
looked after him critically.</p>

<p>“He’s well set-up,” mused Johnny, “but
somehow he doesn’t handle himself like a player.
Looks slow to me, eh?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” agreed Sargent, “but I have Endicott’s
word for it that he’s a good man, and you
know Endicott’s a good judge, Johnny.”</p>

<p>Jim didn’t exactly relish putting himself
under Brandon Gary’s charge, but there was
evidently no help for it. Gary, looking very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
well in his football togs, was looking after, with
a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, some twelve or
fourteen members of the third squad who stood
about in a circle and passed the ball to each
other. Jim observed that they threw the ball
by clasping it with the fingers at one end and
sending it away with a round-arm sweep that
caused the pigskin to revolve on its shorter axis;
also that in catching it the fellows received it
between elbow and thigh, pulling up the right
leg slightly to cradle it. When they missed the
catch they fell on the ball, snuggling it under
them. He made his way to Gary just as that
youth, with an impatient glance toward Sargent,
was receiving the ball.</p>

<p>“The captain told me to report to you,” said
Jim.</p>

<p>Gary turned and viewed him carelessly. “All
right, find a place somewhere,” he answered.
Then recognition dawned and he accorded Jim
a scowl. “Here, stand over there,” he said
curtly. And then, before Jim was well in place,
Gary launched the ball at him swiftly. As the
pigskin had only some eight feet to travel before
it reached Jim, the latter was quite unready for
it, and although he made a desperate attempt
to capture it the ball struck his chest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
bounded crazily away across the grass. Jim
trotted after it and was in the act of picking it
up when Gary bellowed:</p>

<p>“Fall on it, you idiot! None of that here!”</p>

<p>Jim fell. Unfortunately, confusion made him
miss the ball entirely and he had to scramble on
elbows and knees for a full yard before he could
seize the exasperating oval and snuggle it under
him. From behind him came audible, if good-natured,
laughter from the others. Gary alone
seemed unamused.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p141">“Ever see a football before?” he asked</a> as
Jim went back to his place. Jim made no reply
and the pigskin went on around the circle, <em>thump
thump</em>, with an occasional break in the monotony
of the proceedings when some one missed
and had to launch himself to the turf. As the
ball went around, Jim looked over his companions.
He saw none that he recognized. All
were apparently of Jim’s age or younger, and
it was plain to be seen that they constituted
the awkward squad. Whenever the ball reached
Gary he tried his best to make Jim fumble it
again, now throwing it high and now low, but
always as hard as he could. But Jim, watching
the others closely, emulated their way of catching
and only once dropped the ball. Then he
fell on it from where he stood and captured it
very nicely. But Gary declined to let the incident
pass without a reprimand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142-<br />143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep your eyes open, you fellow! You’re
not running a boarding-house now; this is football!”</p>

<p>The allusion to the boarding-house caused
other members of the squad to observe Jim
curiously, but Jim kept his temper and his
tongue. A minute afterwards the coach called
them and the squad broke up. Jim walked over
to the bench and picked up a blanket, but before
he had wrapped it around his shoulders Johnny
was after them.</p>

<p>“Over to the dummy now! And hurry up!”</p>

<p>About thirty panting youths gathered at the
side of the newly spaded pit and one by one
launched themselves at the swinging canvas
dummy. Johnny himself operated the pully
that sent the headless imitation of a man swinging
across the soft loam.</p>

<p>“Pretty good, but tackle lower next time.”</p>

<p>“Perfectly rotten, Curtis. Try it again and
get off your feet. That’s better but not good
enough.”</p>

<p>“All right! Next man! Wrong side. Get
in front of the runner always.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Too low, Page! Aim higher.”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair, Hazard, but put some jump into
it. Remember you’re not patting him on the
back; you’re trying to stop him—and stop him
short. Try again now.”</p>

<p>Jim had never hurled himself at a tackling
dummy before but he had tackled players in a
game and he strove to create the illusion that
the canvas-covered figure was real. The pully
creaked, the dummy slid across the pit, wobbling
and turning, and Jim ran and dived with outstretched
arms. <em>Thump! Rattle!</em> His nose
was buried in the cold loam and his arms were
tightly wrapped about the stuffed canvas legs.
He scrambled to his feet and cast an inquiring
look at the coach. Johnny nodded noncommittally
and Jim took up his place at the end of
the line again. And so it went on for twenty
minutes longer. Jim’s next try brought slight
commendation with the criticism and the third
attempt went off handsomely.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Hazard! Just as though
you meant it. Some of you fellows go at that
dummy as though you were afraid you’d hurt
it. That’ll do for to-day. Back to the bench!
On the trot!”</p>

<p>By now Jim was tuckered and aching, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
one side of his face smeared with dirt and his
right elbow sticking forth from the faded blue
jersey he wore. But football was in his blood
now and so he was highly disappointed when
Johnny called to him and ordered him once
around the field at a jog and back to the gym.</p>

<p>“But I’m not tired, sir,” he ventured.
Johnny scowled.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask you if you were tired,” he said
shortly. “Do as I tell you. Get on the scales
after your shower and let me know your weight.
Maybe you’d better come back here after you’re
dressed and watch scrimmage. I may want to
use you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>So Jim jogged around the field, his eyes on
the others as he went, and wished heartily that
he had come out for the team at the beginning
of the term. Had he done that, he reflected,
he might now be one of the fortunate number
running through signals. Well, he reflected,
he hadn’t done so badly for the first time. He
doubted if Johnny even suspected what a green
candidate he was. And he meant to learn.
They thought he could play good football and
he meant to prove them right!</p>

<p>Half way down the backstretch of the running
track he passed near Poke who was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
through signals with the first squad. Poke
waved to him and grinned.</p>

<p>“How’d you get on?” he called.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” replied Jim. “And I hope
you choke!”</p>

<p>But he really didn’t. He had quite forgiven
Poke by now, for without Poke’s conspiracy
he would probably not be where he was. Completing
the circuit of the field, he trotted off
to the gymnasium, had his shower, found that
he tipped the scales at one hundred and thirty-one
and a half, dressed and hurried back to
the gridiron just in time to see Sargent kick off
the ball for the scrimmage with the second
team. Afterwards he waited for Gil and Poke
and walked home with them through the early
dusk, rather lame and tired but supremely
happy.</p>

<p>At the supper table football was the one subject
and Mrs. Hazard alone failed to show enthusiasm
over Jim’s conversion. She was
very glad, she said, that they were going to
let Jim play if he really wanted to, but she did
wish that football wasn’t quite so dangerous.
Whereupon Poke deluged her with a mass
of impromptu statistics proving beyond the
shadow of a doubt that, with the possible exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of croquet, football was the safest
amusement extant. Mrs. Hazard smiled and
sighed, but remained unconvinced. Mr. Hanks
did not appear at the beginning of the meal,
nor had he come down when the cake and preserves
began to circulate, and Hope was despatched
to his room to summon him. She
returned alone to report that the instructor
wished no supper.</p>

<p>“No supper!” exclaimed Mrs. Hazard.
“But he must have something, Hope. You
shall take some toast and tea up to him. I’ll
set a tray when we’ve finished. I do wish he
would eat more, Jim; I’m getting real worried
about him.”</p>

<p>After supper the boys returned to the porch,
still talking football, while Mrs. Hazard fixed
up a tray for Mr. Hanks and Hope bore it upstairs.
Poke was narrating humorously the
tale of what he called Jim’s deception against
Duncan Sargent and Johnny when Hope appeared
at the hall door, breathless and dismayed.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys!” she cried. “What do you
think has happened?”</p>

<p>Four pairs of startled eyes questioned her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hanks is going to leave!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>MR. HANKS ACCEPTS ADVICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was a moment of silence, broken at
length by Gil.</p>

<p>“Going to leave!” he exclaimed. “You’re
not fooling, Hope?”</p>

<p>“No. I took his tray up and he was writing
at his desk. I told him he just must eat some
supper and he said we were very kind and he
would drink some tea. And then—then he was
afraid he’d been a great deal of trouble to us
and that he wouldn’t be that much longer as he
was going to leave the school. And I said, ‘Oh,
Mr. Hanks!’—just like that—and he said he
was sorry to leave and—and he thanked me for
bringing the tray and—and I ran out of
the room because—because—” Hope’s eyes
were “because” enough. The boys looked
away while she dashed a wisp of a handkerchief
across them. Poke whistled between his teeth,
much out of tune. “I—I think it’s just—just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
too horrid for anything!” ended Hope
tremulously.</p>

<p>Jim stirred his feet uneasily and Gil cleared
his throat as if to speak and then evidently
thought better of it. Hope subsided on the arm
of a porch rocker. It was Jeffrey who spoke
first.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” he said. “I suppose
we’re all to blame to some extent.”</p>

<p>“If he had any grit—” began Poke.</p>

<p>“I’d like to punch that fellow’s head,” Jim
growled.</p>

<p>“What fellow? Bull Gary?” asked Gil.</p>

<p>Jim nodded.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” demanded
Hope anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t see that there’s anything we can
do,” answered Gil. “I’m sorry he’s going, for
he really isn’t a bad sort. But he’d never get
on here because the fellows have found out that
they can do just as they please with him. If
he’d put his foot down hard the first day and
made Bull and a few of the others walk the
plank he wouldn’t have had any trouble. As it
is now I guess he’s wise to quit.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough for you,” demurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Jim, “but we can’t afford to lose a lodger. So,
by hooky, something’s just got to be done!”</p>

<p>“If we went up and asked him to stay don’t
you think perhaps he would?” asked Hope.</p>

<p>“Sure! He’d do anything to oblige us,” replied
Poke ironically.</p>

<p>“You needn’t be sarcastic,” murmured Hope
aggrievedly. “I don’t think you’ve been very
nice about it anyway, Poke.”</p>

<p>There was a silence after this that lasted until
Jeffrey, who had been staring thoughtfully into
the dusk, said:</p>

<p>“Look here, if some one can induce Nancy
to turn over a new leaf now and—er—buck
up, you know, he won’t have much trouble, will
he? It isn’t too late, is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” said Gil.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said Poke. “But he wouldn’t
do it; he doesn’t know how.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’d mind if we suggested
something of the sort to him?” pursued Jeffrey.
The rest looked doubtful, but Hope broke out
eagerly with:</p>

<p>“Of course he wouldn’t! He’s just as nice
and—and good-natured as he can be. Let’s
do it!”</p>

<p>But Poke hung back. “He’d probably tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
us to mind our own miserable business,” he objected.</p>

<p>“There’d be no harm in trying it,” said Jim.
“Let’s all go up and tell him we’ve heard that
he’s going to leave and that we’re sorry and—and—”</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked Poke. “Tell him
he doesn’t know his business and that he’s made
a mess of things?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jeffrey quietly. “It’s
so, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“If you’ll do the talking,” suggested Jim,
“it’ll be all right, Jeff. What do you say,
Gil?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Poke, I think you might!” wailed
Hope. “It’s partly your fault, and you know
it is, and I think you might do what you can
to—to help.”</p>

<p>“Gee, you talk as though I was to blame for
everything,” Poke growled. “Anybody would
think—”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the grouch,” said Gil. “Nobody’s
asking you to do anything except go up
there and hear Jeff talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think you’d better do the talking,” objected
Jeffrey. “You’re the oldest, Gil.”</p>

<p>“You can do it better. If you need help the
rest of us will come to your assistance. Ready
now? Know what you’re going to say?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” laughed Jeffrey, “but I
guess I can stumble through with it.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Jim eagerly. “Let’s go before
we lose courage.”</p>

<p>So, Gil and Jeffrey leading and Poke ambling
along behind with his hands in his pockets and
a general expression of disapprobation about
him, the five mounted the stairs and knocked at
the door of the instructor’s room. Bidden to
enter, <a href="#i_p153">they found Mr. Hanks at his desk</a>, pen in
hand and a pile of manuscript at his elbow. He
had taken his tea, Hope observed, but nothing
else on the tray had been touched. As the
embassy filed into the room Mr. Hanks arose
from his chair with a look of surprise and embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir,” began Jeffrey. “May
we come in for a minute if you’re not too
busy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_152">They found Mr. Hanks at his desk.</a></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154-<br />155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Er—certainly! How do you do? Won’t
you—won’t you be seated?” Mr. Hanks
glanced around nervously in search of accommodations.
Gil and Poke simplified matters by
seating themselves on the edge of the bed, leaving
the chairs for the others. Mr. Hanks laid
aside the tortoise-shell spectacles he was wearing,
pushed his manuscript aside, drew it back
again, smiled doubtfully and subsided in his
chair.</p>

<p>“You—er—you wanted to see me?” he
asked, clearing his throat nervously.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Jeffrey. “Hope has
just told us, sir, that you are thinking of leaving
Crofton.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mr. Hanks glanced down at his papers.
“Yes, I have decided to resign,” he replied,
in tones which he strove to make sound
businesslike and matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>“We’re awfully sorry to hear it, Mr.
Hanks,” said Jeffrey earnestly.</p>

<p>“Terribly sorry,” said Hope.</p>

<p>“Very,” said Gil.</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Jim.</p>

<p>Poke growled something inarticulate.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks glanced around in surprise and
embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Why—er—that’s very good of you all,
very kind of you, I’m sure,” he murmured.
“I—I regret the necessity of leaving, myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I was getting very fond of the school, quite attached.
And this place—” he looked about
the room—“suits me very well. The light is
excellent, you see, and owing to the fact that my
eyes are not what they used to be I have to be
very particular about—er—about light.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Jeffrey. “Mr. Hanks,
maybe we’re sort of intruding on your affairs,
sir, but when we heard about your leaving we
got to talking it over and we decided that we’d
come up here and ask you to—to reconsider.”
Mr. Hanks opened his mouth to speak, but
Jeffrey hurried on. “We may be wrong, sir,
but our idea is that you’re leaving because
some of us haven’t been acting very well in
class.”</p>

<p>“I think I have no complaint to make about
any of you young gentlemen,” replied Mr.
Hanks, looking from one to the other and allowing
his eyes to rest on Poke, for what the
youth thought was an unnecessary length of
time. “But I won’t attempt to deny that your—your
assumption is correct, Latham. The
fact is that I am, I find, quite unsuited to the
work here. The position I have tried to fill requires
a man with more experience than I have
had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“May we talk right out plain, Mr. Hanks?”
asked Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“Why, I think so,” replied the instructor, a
trifle bewildered.</p>

<p>“Then what we came up here to say, sir, is
just this. There isn’t any reason why you
should leave us on account of what’s been going
on in class. Of course we fellows haven’t any
right to act the way we’ve been acting, but I
guess it’s more than half your fault, Mr.
Hanks. You see, sir, if you’d started right
with us we’d have behaved ourselves, but you
didn’t understand, I guess. If you’d sent a
couple of fellows up to Mr. Gordon the first
time there was trouble the whole thing would
have stopped right there, but you didn’t and
the fellows think now they can do as they please.
That’s where the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“Er—yes—I dare say. Yes, I realize
now that I should have acted—er—differently,
that I should have been—er—stern.”
(Gil tried not to grin at the thought of Mr.
Hanks being stern.) “Doubtless, I have, as
you say, followed a mistaken course with the
classes. I see that now. But the damage is
done, Latham, and so—so I think the best
thing to do is to retire in favor of some man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who can—er—who understands you young
gentlemen better than I do.” Poke thought he
detected a faint emphasis on the word gentlemen.
He hadn’t meant to open his mouth, but
he suddenly found himself speaking.</p>

<p>“What’s the use, sir?” he asked. “Why
don’t you stick it out and start over, sir? Kick
a few fellows out of class, send a few up to J. G.
and sock some extra work onto a few more?
That’ll fix ’em in the shake of a lamb’s tail! It
isn’t too late, Mr. Hanks.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks shook his head, however. “I’m
afraid it is,” he said. “Anything I might do
now would be quite futile. They have—er—taken
my measure, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you, sir,” said Gil.
“I think Poke is right. I think if you’ll start
in to-morrow and sit down hard on the first
fellow who starts anything you’ll have things in
shape in no time at all. Of course, you’ll have
to keep it up for awhile, sir, but it won’t be long
before the fellows will find out that you’re not
to be monkeyed with. You see, sir, the fact is
none of us have anything against you; I guess
we all like you pretty well; anyhow, this bunch
here does; it’s just that here at Crofton every
new faculty has to be hazed a little. Usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
they stand about so much of it and then something
drops and it’s all over. You didn’t quite
understand, sir, and you let things run along.
Why not do as Poke says, Mr. Hanks? Why
not stay where you are and hit out from the
shoulder once or twice?”</p>

<p>“Hit out from—You don’t mean <em>strike</em>
any one?” gasped the instructor.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” Gil laughed, “not actually. I
mean punish some one good and hard; set an example
for the whole class.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Mr. Hanks was visibly relieved.
“You—you think that would—er—accomplish
something?”</p>

<p>“I’m certain of it,” replied Gil decidedly.</p>

<p>“Sure to,” said Poke.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks played with his pen for a minute.
Then he looked up with a helpless smile at Gil.</p>

<p>“What—what could I do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, the first time any fellow does anything
in class he shouldn’t, call him down.”</p>

<p>“Call him down?” questioned Mr. Hanks,
at a loss.</p>

<p>“Reprimand him, I mean. Then if he
doesn’t behave send him to Mr. Gordon. Mr.
Gordon will stand back of you, sir; he always
does. Take Gary for instance, sir. If you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
that just once with him he’d come back as meek
as a kitten.”</p>

<p>“And what would Mr. Gordon do to him?”</p>

<p>Gil shrugged his shoulders. “He might do
most anything, sir. It would depend on what
Gary had done. He might put him on probation,
he might send him home for the rest of
the term, he might expel him for keeps.”</p>

<p>“But I shouldn’t want anything like that to
happen to the boy,” said Mr. Hanks in alarm.
“He has been very trying to me; in fact, I
have sometimes suspected that in a way he has
been at the bottom of most of my troubles, what
I might call a ringleader, Benton.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that might be,” replied Gil
gravely.</p>

<p>“Yes. But even so I should very much dislike
to be the cause of his being sent from school
even temporarily.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t be if you told J. G. to be
easy with him,” said Poke. “That’s what
Gary needs, though, Mr. Hanks, a good scare.
You throw one into him and see what a difference
it will make.”</p>

<p>“I do wish you’d try it, please, sir,” said
Hope.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks was silent a moment. Once he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
sighed deeply. Once he smiled slightly at the
pen he was rolling between his long fingers.
Finally he looked up.</p>

<p>“This has been very kind of you,” he said
quietly. “I appreciate your—your interest.
I thank you—all.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll try it?” cried Hope eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks smiled and shook his head. “I
must consider it,” he answered. “The plan is—is
revolutionary. I have great doubts of my
ability in the rôle you have assigned me. But—I
will think it over.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile you’ll stay, won’t you,
sir?” asked Jim anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall—er—postpone any action in
regard to my resignation for the present. I—I
have no wish to leave here. My room is very
comfortable and the light is—er—excellent.”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t want you to leave,” said
Poke gruffly. “And I guess you won’t need to
if you take our advice, sir. Good night, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” responded Mr. Hanks, rising,
“good night. I thank you all very much.”</p>

<p>“Shall I take your tray away?” asked Hope.</p>

<p>“Eh? Why—er—no. I rather think I’ll
eat a little of the—er—whatever it is. I
really feel a bit hungry.”</p>

<small>ON THE SECOND</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Whether Mr. Hanks meant to profit by
the advice so frankly given him remained
a question for several days. On Friday
his classes in Latin and history presented
the usual disordered appearance and the instructor’s
attitude remained the same. It
seemed to Gil, however, that Mr. Hanks was a
little quieter and a little less nervous than usual;
that he was silently studying the situation.
But Gil may only have imagined that. There
were no actual outbreaks of disorder on Friday,
although Brandon Gary and his crowd indulged
to their hearts’ content in minor annoyances.
Saturday Mr. Hanks had only classes
in Latin and for almost the first time since his
appearance at Crofton recitations went off
quietly and in order, due to the fact that the
first football game of the season was to be
played that afternoon and every fellow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
school was much too absorbed in that to have
either time or inclination for mischief.</p>

<p>On Friday Jim had weathered another day of
practice without results damaging to his reputation
for skill and experience. He had signal
practice with the third squad and by dint of
maintaining an appearance of ease and doing
what the others did as best he could he had
managed to deceive even Johnny Connell.
Johnny was puzzled however. He confided as
much to Duncan Sargent.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand how he can handle himself
as awkwardly as he does, Cap,” said
Johnny. “He seems to know what to do all
right, but he makes all sorts of false moves
while he’s doing it.”</p>

<p>“He can play, though, can’t he?” asked Sargent,
his mind only half on the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, it looks so,” answered Johnny.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see what we can do with him.
If we take Curtis from the second squad we’ll
need some one in his place who can put up a
fight against Cosgrove. Think Hazard would
fit in?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. He’s got the build and he’s
strong as a colt—and just about as awkward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Of course, that may be because he hasn’t had
much practice.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” murmured the captain.
“What time is it? Can we start the
scrimmage?”</p>

<p>On Saturday all Sunnywood went to the
game, Gil and Poke to play, Jim to sit on the
substitutes’ bench, Jeffrey, with Mrs. Hazard
and Hope as his guests, to follow the play with
the keenest enjoyment and to elucidate to his
companions what everything meant. Crofton
High School was not a dangerous opponent, although
in the matter of practice she was a whole
fortnight ahead of Crofton. Her work showed
a finish that was quite absent from that of the
home eleven and only the fact that her team was
lighter and her plays old fashioned allowed
Crofton to win the contest. At the end of the
second period Crofton had a touchdown and a
safety to her credit and High School had only
once been dangerous. Then a try at goal from
the twenty-five yards had gone badly astray.
In the third period four substitutes went in for
Crofton and there was no scoring by either
team. The fourth period began for the Crimson-and-Gray
with what was practically an entirely
new eleven, only Tearney at right end and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Poke at right half remaining in. The periods
were ten minutes long and when only six
minutes of the game remained Crofton High
began to make headway through the Academy’s
line and at last secured a second try at goal from
the field. This time her kicker was successful
from the thirty-two-yard line and High School
chalked three points to her credit. It was after
that feat, while the teams were resuming their
places for the kick-off, that Johnny beckoned to
Jim, who, sandwiched in between big Andy LaGrange,
the first string center, and “Punk”
Gibbs of the second, had been comfortably
watching the progress of the conflict with no
thought of participating. Jim stared unbelievingly
until Johnny called him impatiently
and Gibbs dug an unkind elbow against his ribs.
Then Jim squirmed from the bench and struggled
with his sweater.</p>

<p>“Go in for Curtis at left tackle,” said
Johnny. “You know the signals, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Jim nodded, trying hard to recall one single
thing about them!</p>

<p>“All right. Hurry up. Show me what you
can do. And play low, Hazard!”</p>

<p>Jim sped out on to the gridiron, searching
wildly for the referee, his heart thumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
alarmingly as he realized that he was to take
part in an actual contest. He found the official,
sent Curtis off grumbling and took his
place. Perhaps luckily for Jim he was not
called on for any special feats of prowess during
the short time that remained, for he was decidedly
nervous. To his credit, however, it
may be said that he broke through well and, on
the defense, held his adversary fairly. There
was no more scoring and just as Jim had regained
his confidence and was beginning to enjoy
the fray the final whistle was blown and it
was all over, the score 7 to 3 in favor of the
Academy.</p>

<p>In the gymnasium later Jim ran into Duncan
Sargent. Sargent, his powerful body, scantily
draped with a bath towel, glowing from the effects
of a shower, stopped him.</p>

<p>“Good work, Hazard,” he said cordially.
“I watched you to-day. Keep it up and we’ll
find a place for you before the season’s done.
There’s just one thing, though, old man, and
that is: <em>Play low!</em> Try to remember that, will
you?” And the captain passed on with a
smile and a nod, leaving Jim very pleased and
a little remorseful.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one was more delighted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
events of the afternoon than Hope. She made
heroes of Gil and Poke and Jim, and especially
Jim. “You played perfectly jimmy!” she declared.
“And I saw Grace Andrews there and
I was just as proud and sticky as—as anything!
Wasn’t it too funny, Jim, you should
have played against her brother?”</p>

<p>“Was that who he was?” asked Jim. “I
didn’t know his name. He’s pretty light for a
tackle.”</p>

<p>(Jim, you see, was already talking like an
expert.)</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, you played all around him.
Jeff said so. And we beat them, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“We ought to. We were pounds heavier,
sis.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could have seen Lady when
Jeff told her that you were going to play. She
covered up her face with her hands and then
looked through her fingers every minute!”</p>

<p>That was Jim’s baptism by fire and those few
minutes of play gave him new courage to go on
with his rôle. On Monday practice was lengthened
and the work became a good deal like
drudgery. One had to have a real passion for
football in order to really get any enjoyment
out of the proceedings. For the first part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the week scrimmaging was abandoned entirely,
and Johnny, who had detected a lack of fundamental
knowledge in the players, took them
back to first principles, and even Duncan Sargent
himself was put to tackling the dummy
and handling the ball. On Thursday the one
scrimmage of the week was held and Jim fought
through ten minutes on the second team at left
tackle and had his hands very full in keeping
Cosgrove and Shepard, who opposed him, from
making him look like the inexperienced player
he was. But Jim kept his wits about him,
worked hard, bluffed harder, and pulled through
creditably. And every day now he was gaining
knowledge and knack and football sense.
And every day the awkwardness which had puzzled
the trainer was wearing off. Jim had
strength of body and plenty of sound sense, and
he was developing both every day. And so,
by the end of that week, the school was taking
notice of him and fellows were discussing his
chance of ousting Curtis from the second team.
In short, he had made good. And Poke was as
pleased as might be.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Jimmy, my boy?” he
asked that Friday night. “Didn’t I tell you
I’d make a real player out of you? Didn’t I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
tell you you’d be down on your knees thanking
me for my efforts in your behalf, you ungrateful
pup?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going down on my knees,”
laughed Jim. “They’re much too lame.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jim,” broke in Jeffrey excitedly,
“if you can manage to get on the first
team before the season’s through think what
it would mean! Why, out of eleven men
there’d be three from Sunnywood!”</p>

<p>“Rah for Sunnywood!” cried Poke.
“Don’t you worry, Senator; Jim will make the
first yet. I’ve got it all doped out. Listen,
my children: Marshall won’t last long. He’s
a good player, but he had whooping cough or
something—”</p>

<p>“Measles,” corrected Gil.</p>

<p>“Well, measles, then, in the summer, and he
can’t stand the pace. Johnny sees that already.
That’s why Curtis has been playing at left
tackle in practice. But Curtis is too slow. He
may stay first choice, but it’s pounds to pennies
that if Jim keeps on coming he will find
himself first sub when the Hawthorne game
comes along. Now you fellows mark my
words!”</p>

<p>“You’re a wonderful little prophet, Poke,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
said Gil. “Still, I shouldn’t be surprised if
things turned out something like that. Keep
it up, Jim. You’re doing fine!”</p>

<p>“Think I’ll get in to-morrow?” asked Jim
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Sure to for a while,” replied Poke.
“Why, Dun Sargent’s tickled to death with
you. He’s thanked me half a dozen times for
getting you out. And now he thinks I’m the
one best bet as a football scout. Wants me to
keep my eyes open and find him a good left end
in Gil’s place.” And Poke scampered before
Gil could reach him.</p>

<p>Jim did get into the next day’s game, just as
Poke had predicted, and although he had one
bad fumble to his discredit he played a good
game through one whole period and more than
atoned for his fault. And Jim was not the only
one to fumble the pigskin that day. Even Gil
lost the chance of a clean touchdown by letting
the ball roll out of his arms when tackled on the
five-yard line, while Arnold, the quarter-back,
twice offended. But in spite of these misadventures
Crofton had no trouble in rolling up
seventeen points against her adversary.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Hanks had given no sign.
There was less trouble in his classes nowadays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
possibly because the whole school was so much
interested in football, and it began to look as
though the instructor’s troubles were over.
But on the following Tuesday, Brandon Gary,
realizing possibly, that he had neglected his duties
as a cut-up, gave his attention again to
Mr. Hanks. That was at five minutes past ten.</p>

<p>At a quarter past ten Gary was sitting in
Mr. Gordon’s office.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock it was known all over school
that Bull Gary was on probation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>GARY IS SURPRISED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Let Gil and Poke tell about Gary’s surprise
party, for they were eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>“You could have knocked me over with a
feather,” declared Poke—the four Sunnywood
boys were on their way back to the cottage at
noon—“and I never thought Nancy Hanks
had it in him! Here’s the way it was. Most
of the class were in their seats and Mort Nichols—he’s
monitor, you know—was calling
the roll. When he got to the G’s he skipped
Bull’s name because he could see that Bull
wasn’t there. Mort’s rather a chum of Bull’s,
you know. But Nancy was on to him.
‘You’ve left out a name, Nichols,’ says he.
‘Go back, please.’ So Mort gets sort of red
and calls, ‘Gary.’ And Bull, who had just
come loafing in at the door says, ‘Dead on the
field of battle,’ and the fellows began to laugh.
It really was funny, wasn’t it, Gil?”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pshaw! You laughed, too. I saw you.
Well, Nancy never turned a hair—”</p>

<p>“The funny thing,” interrupted Gil, “was
the way Mr. Hanks was looking. He was sort
of white and frightened and he had his mouth
set in a straight line like—like this.” And
Gil illustrated. “I never saw him look that
way before.”</p>

<p>“And he had a funny little sparkle in his
eyes,” said Poke. “Did you notice that,
Gil?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He really looked kind of dangerous
and I was mighty glad I wasn’t Bull Gary just
then.”</p>

<p>“Well, get on with your story,” said Jim.
“Then what happened?”</p>

<p>“Then,” replied Gil, “Mr. Hanks said,
‘Are we to understand by that cryptic remark,
Gary, that you desire to be marked as present?’
And Bull was so flabbergasted that all
he could do was stammer, ‘Y-yes, sir.’ ‘Mark
Gary present,’ said Mr. Hanks. So Mort went
on with the roll and we began the recitation,
all the fellows looking at each other and wondering
what had happened to Mr. Hanks.
Marshall was reciting when there was a crash
at the back of the room. It seems that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Bull had reached out with his foot and poked
over a pile of books on Punk Gibbs’ desk. Mr.
Hanks held up a hand and Marshall stopped.
‘Whose books are those?’ he asked. ‘Mine,
sir,’ replied Punk very, very meekly. ‘Pick
them up, please.’ So Punk picked them up and
put them back and the room was very quiet.
Every one was grinning, but no one made a
sound. Marshall started off again when—<em>bang!</em>
went the pile of books once more. Mr.
Hanks lifted his hand. ‘Whose books are
those?’ he asked again. ‘Mine,’ said Punk,
looking sort of scared. ‘Pick them up, please.’
‘I didn’t knock them off,’ grumbled Punk.
‘Who did?’ asked Mr. Hanks. But Punk
wouldn’t tell. Then Mr. Hanks said, ‘The student
who pushed those books onto the floor will
kindly pick them up.’ No one moved for a
minute. ‘We will wait,’ said Mr. Hanks, and
sat down again in his chair. Finally Punk
grumbled something and started to pick them
up, when Mr. Hanks said: ‘Let them alone,
Gibbs!’ And Punk sat up as though he was
shot. Another minute or so passed. Some
one began to snigger nervously at the back of
the room. ‘Who’s that laughing?’ asked Mr.
Hanks. After that there wasn’t a sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Finally Mr. Hanks looked at the clock. ‘I’ve
given you plenty of time,’ he said, ‘but you may
have thirty seconds more in which to replace
those books,’ and he looked straight at Bull.
Bull grinned, but didn’t move.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” broke in Poke, “he was
getting pretty nervous.”</p>

<p>“We all were,” said Gil. “Finally Mr.
Hanks said, ‘Time’s up, Gary. You’re delaying
the recitation.’ ‘I didn’t knock them off,’
said Bull in his ugliest tones. ‘You didn’t?’
asked Mr. Hanks very quietly. ‘Think well,
Gary, before you answer.’ Bull looked around
and grinned. ‘No, I didn’t,’ said he. And
then Mr. Hanks, our quiet little Nancy Hanks,
exploded a bombshell. ‘Report to Mr. Gordon,
Gary,’ said he sternly. Bull sat and
looked at him with his mouth wide open, too
surprised to speak, and the rest of us just
gasped. Finally Bull said, ‘What for, sir?’
in that bullying way of his, and Mr. Hanks came
back at him like a flash. ‘For disturbance in
class and lying!’ he said!”</p>

<p>“And that,” murmured Poke, “was the way
the battle was fit.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Jim. “Gary must have been
surprised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did he go right away?” asked Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“Like a lamb,” answered Gil. “And then,
‘Please continue, Marshall,’ said Mr. Hanks.
And there wasn’t a better-behaved class in
school than we were!”</p>

<p>“Just what we told him would happen,” declared
Poke. “He ought to be mighty grateful
to us for giving him the tip.”</p>

<p>“He will probably send up a set of engraved
resolutions, thanking us,” said Jim dryly.</p>

<p>“What I want to know is,” remarked Jeffrey
as they passed through the cottage gate, “what
the team’s going to do without Gary at right
guard.”</p>

<p>“I wonder myself,” mused Gil as they
took their places on the porch. “Probably
they’ll bring Parker over from the second.
But it’s going to weaken the team like anything.”</p>

<p>“How long will J. G. keep him on pro?”
asked Poke.</p>

<p>“Search me. Maybe he will let him back in
time for the big game. That’s not much more
than a month away now.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will,” said Jeffrey. “We certainly
need him in the line.”</p>

<p>“But think of Nancy rearing up and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
saucy like that!” marveled Poke. “I could
hardly believe my own little eyes, fellows!”</p>

<p>“It’s a case of the worm will turn,” observed
Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“And here comes the worm,” whispered
Jim.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks came along the road with a bundle
of blue books under his arm. He had discarded
his straw hat for a faded black Fedora
that was perhaps two sizes too large for him
and that settled down over his forehead in
a desperate and rakish manner. To-day it
seemed to the boys on the porch that the instructor
held his head more erect and stepped
out more briskly. When he came up the steps
they were all on their feet and unconsciously
there was a new respect in the way in which
they stood at attention and took off their caps.
Mr. Hanks bowed his jerky bow and passed
them silently. When he was heard mounting
the stairs Jim observed thoughtfully:</p>

<p>“‘Nancy’ doesn’t seem to fit him so well
to-day, fellows.”</p>

<p>Naturally enough Mr. Hanks’ astounding
change from the meek and lowly victim to the
high-handed martinet was a nine days’ wonder.
During that nine days three other members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of his classes were punished in various
ways and from that time on recitations in Latin
and history were conducted with a decorum
that soon became the envy of other instructors.
Mr. Hanks never spoke to Gil or Poke, Jim or
Jeffrey about the matter, nor did he ever show
them any special consideration in class, but in
some way they all understood that he was grateful,
and with their new respect for him was a
stronger liking.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile football affairs were at
sixes and sevens for the better part of a week,
for Gary’s probation prohibited him from taking
part in athletics and when he left the team
the team lost one of its strongest units. Parker
was tried, but found wanting. Springer, left
guard on the second, was brought across to the
first but fared badly in the first game played.
Finally Cosgrove, right tackle on the first, was
moved to Gary’s vacant place, and Curtis, of
the second, was promoted to right tackle on
the first. Whereupon, presto!—Mr. James
Hazard found himself with disconcerted suddenness
playing left tackle on the second team!
And the season was half over and already the
Hawthorne game loomed large and impending
on the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>To say that Jim was pleased is putting it but
mildly. To say that he was secretly alarmed
is no more than the truth. It is one thing to
serve as a substitute and be put in for five or
ten minutes when the game is safe and quite
another to be a first string man. On defense
Jim found himself opposed to Tearney, right
end on the first, and that was not so bad, but
on the attack he had Cosgrove in front of him
and Cosgrove was an old and experienced
player with a most irritating trick of coaxing
Jim off-side, for which, for the first week or
so, Jim was forever being censured by coach
and captain and quarter-back. Of course playing
on the second team is not as momentous
an affair as being on the ’varsity, but it’s the
next biggest thing, and if any one thinks that
a second team doesn’t take itself very seriously
they should have watched proceedings at Crofton
that fall. The second, captained by Page,
the tiny quarter-back, went into every tussle
as though the fair honor of Crofton was in their
keeping. The second regretted the loss of Curtis,
but speedily made Jim welcome to their
ranks. He soon got close to several fellows
well worth knowing and within a fortnight was
“Jim” to every member of the team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>At Sunnywood, true to their promise, <a href="#i_p181">Gil
and Poke assisted in the household duties</a> every
morning and evening. Mrs. Hazard had instead
of one majordomo three cheerfully willing
assistants. Chilly weather had come and the
furnace had begun its duty, and in the morning
the three boys descended to the cellar and
put it in shape, raking out ashes and sifting
them, shoveling coal, picking over cinders and
splitting kindling for the kitchen. Jeffrey, although
barred from taking an active part in the
chores, made himself useful whenever possible.
In the evening a somewhat similar program was
carried out, and at ten o’clock Poke, who had
evolved certain theories for the scientific management
of furnaces, went down and fixed the
fire for the night. In this way Jim had plenty
of time to pursue the gentle art of football.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">It was shortly after Mr. Hanks’ disconcerting
assumption of the rôle of despot that Jeffrey
crossed the hall to Gil and Poke’s room one
Friday evening.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows still grinding?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We are still studying,” responded Poke.
“Please try to abstain from slang, Mr. Latham.
I don’t care so much about myself, but it sets
a bad example for my friend across the table.
I have to be very careful about him. His parents
have placed him in my charge, you see.
Well, what’s on your mind, old top?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” said Jeffrey gravely.</p>

<p>“I know.” Poke nodded sympathetically.
“It does make you feel sort of queer, doesn’t
it? Have a glass of water?”</p>

<p>“That might give him water on the brain,”
observed Gil, looking up from his book.</p>

<p>Poke observed him sorrowfully. “Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
humor, Gil, is heavy, very heavy. Go on with
your Latin, my poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“How the dickens can I, when you two chaps
are talking?” asked Gil mildly, pushing his
book away.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d be through,” said Jeffrey.
“I’ll come in again later.”</p>

<p>“Sit still, Jeff. I am through. I was just
taking a fall out of Monday’s stuff. Where’s
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Over there; studying math.” Jeffrey indicated
his room with a jerk of his head. “I’ve
been thinking—”</p>

<p>“You said that before,” interrupted Poke
sweetly.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Poke! Let him think if he wants
to. Just because you never do it—”</p>

<p>“Let him tell it, Gil, can’t you? Always interrupting
and annoying folks with your
beastly chatter. Go ahead, Jeff; don’t mind
him; you’ve been thinking; now what’s the
rest? Bet you I know the answer!”</p>

<p>Jeff aimed a blow at Poke’s shins with the
end of a crutch and Poke kicked his feet up just
in time. “He’s getting crutchity, Gil,” he
said sadly.</p>

<p>Gil threatened him with a book from the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and Poke retired to the other side of the
room.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Jeff, taking advantage of
Poke’s retreat to state his errand, “you see,
fellows, I’ve been thinking—”</p>

<p>There was a chuckle from the window seat
which turned quickly into a cough as Gil swung
around in that direction, the book still in his
hand. Jeffrey smiled.</p>

<p>“Thinking,” he went on, “about getting a
canoe.”</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’m glad you aren’t thinking
about getting a steam yacht!” ejaculated Poke.
“You’d have brain fever by this time!”</p>

<p>“They say there’s a man named Sandford
up the river who makes corkers.”</p>

<p>“There is; at Riverbend. There are two
or three up there who make canoes,” replied
Gil.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve always heard that Sandford’s
were the best. I think—”</p>

<p>“He’s at it again!” groaned Poke, who had
fortified himself with half a dozen cushions.
“He’s at it again!”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll buy one. Oughtn’t I get a
pretty good one for thirty dollars, Gil?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know, Jeff. Never bought a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
canoe in my life. I would think so, though.
How about it, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I to be allowed to speak?” asked
Poke in a muffled voice from behind his breastworks.
“Had to come to old Poke when you
wanted to know something, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up, you idiot!” laughed Gil.
“How much do canoes cost?”</p>

<p>Poke emerged in a shower of cushions.
“Canoes?” he asked. “Well now, what kind
of canoes? There are canvas canoes, wooden
canoes, paper canoes, birch-bark canoes, steel
canoes, dug-outs—”</p>

<p>“Dug-outs, of course,” replied Gil sarcastically.
“Those are what Sandford makes,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Irony doesn’t become you,” responded
Poke critically. “Irony, Gil, should be indulged
in only by those having an iron constitution.
Returning to the subject of canoes and
the cost thereof—”</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars will probably buy you a
first-class one, Jeff,” Gil interrupted. “When
are you going to—”</p>

<p>“Thirty dollars will buy a very fair one
only,” Poke corrected. “Allow me, if you
please, to speak on this subject. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
there is no one in Crofton who has more knowledge
of canoes than I, Jeff. Canoes are—are
an open book to me. I can tell you where to
buy them, how to buy them, when to buy them—and
when not to! Also, I have full knowledge
of what to feed them and how to bring
them up. I suppose I’ve brought up more
canoes—”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Poke, you’re silly,” said Gil disgustedly.
“We’re talking seriously, so shut
up or get out, will you?”</p>

<p>“I can be just as serious as you can, you old
Mr. Grouch!” Poke returned to his chair at
the table, wearing an expression of intense
dignity. “Sandford’s eighteen-foot canoe,
Jeff, costs forty-two dollars, but you can get a
dandy sixteen-footer for thirty-five. It isn’t
finished quite as nicely, I believe. Sometimes
you can pick up a good second-hand one up
there. Perky Wright has one he only paid
about fifteen for. I don’t think it came from
Sandford, though. What’s that other fellow’s
name up there, Gil?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. There are two or three
others, aren’t there? Was Perky’s second-hand
when he got it, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he had the fellow paint it all up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as good as new. You’d never have known it
had been used before he got it, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather have a brand-new one,”
said Jeff doubtfully. “And I wouldn’t want
an eighteen-footer; sixteen is long enough.
Couldn’t you fellows go up there with me in
the morning and help me buy it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Gil answered. “We’d have
to go early, though; dinner’s at twelve to-morrow
on account of the game.”</p>

<p>“We can go up on the train,” said Poke.
“Take the eight-something and be there in
five minutes.”</p>

<p>“I thought we might paddle up,” suggested
Jeff. “It wouldn’t take very long.”</p>

<p>“Hm, and who would do the paddling?”
asked Poke with elaborate carelessness.</p>

<p>“I’d do most of it,” Jeffrey replied, “if
some one would take a hand in the bow.”</p>

<p>“That’s Gil, then. He’s tried it and I never
have. How many can we get in a canoe? Is
Jim going along?”</p>

<p>“No, he says he can’t. But I thought we
might take Hope if she’d like to go.”</p>

<p>“Four of us in one frail bark?” demurred
Poke.</p>

<p>“Of course; easy as pie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve seen six fellows in some of our canoes
here,” said Gil. “But I’m afraid you and I’ll
be a bit tired by the time we reach Riverbend,
Jeff. However, we can come back with the current.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” exclaimed Poke, “I wish we didn’t
have a game to-morrow. We could take some
grub with us and have a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Fine! Couldn’t we do it anyway?” Jeff
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why not, Poke? Johnny will let us off,”
said Gil. “We’ll get Lady to put us up a nice
big basket of grub and we’ll find a place along
the river and have a fine old time! Why can’t
Jim come along?”</p>

<p>“He says he has to attend to some things
around the house in the morning,” answered
Jeff.</p>

<p>“Shucks! Where is he? I’ll attend to
him!” And Poke disappeared across the
hall.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to make sure and be back by
one-thirty,” said Gil. “Game’s at two-thirty
to-morrow, you know. We’ll put on our old
things so we can fall overboard if we want to.
By the way, Jeff, what would happen to you if
the old thing did upset?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d swim ashore, I hope,” laughed Jeff.</p>

<p>“Really? Can you swim with—with
those?” Gil was looking at the crutches.</p>

<p>“No, I usually leave these behind when I
go in swimming,” replied Jeffrey with a smile.
“Swim is one thing I can do fairly well, Gil.
Funny, though, isn’t it? I suppose I do most
of it with my good leg, although I seem to get
some push with the other, too. If we upset, you
look after yourself; don’t worry about me; I
dare say I’d be ashore as soon as you.”</p>

<p>“Here he is!” cried Poke in the doorway.
He had Jim by the coat collar. “Now apologize
to Mr. Latham for so rudely refusing his
kind invitation!”</p>

<p>“I apologize,” laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll go with us?” cried Jeffrey.</p>

<p>Jim hesitated. “I oughtn’t to,” he began.</p>

<p>“Oh, feathers!” said Poke, giving him a
shake. “Of course you’ll come. What have
you got to do here, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Lots of things; lay a carpet, for one.”</p>

<p>“Lay it after you get back,” suggested Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“I want to see the game, thank you. Maybe,
though, I can do it to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can; carpets lay better in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
evening, anyhow.” And Poke released his
prisoner.</p>

<p>“Will Hope come along?” asked Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Jim replied. “Want me to
find out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and say, Jim, while you’re about it
see if Lady will get up some sandwiches and
things for us, will you?”</p>

<p>“Of course she will.” Jim went out to seek
his mother and sister, and Poke began to
chuckle.</p>

<p>“What are you crying about?” asked Gil.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing much, thank you. I was just
wondering which of us, if Hope comes, is to
swim. For I’ll be switched if I want to go five
in a canoe.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Jeff. “I hadn’t thought
of that. Couldn’t we take two canoes, Gil?”</p>

<p>“If we can get them, but some one will have
to get to the boat-house pretty early or they’ll
be taken; that is, if it’s a decent day. And who
will paddle the second one?”</p>

<p>“Jim,” replied Jeffrey. “He can paddle
very well now. I’ve been showing him how.”</p>

<p>“And who will take the bow paddle?” asked
Poke uneasily.</p>

<p>“You, you lazy dub,” responded Gil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
promptly. “If you can’t paddle a canoe it’s
time you learned how. You and Jeff can go in
one canoe, with Hope, and Jim and I will take
the other.”</p>

<p>“All right, but don’t blame me if something
awful happens. I am subject to cramps, and
if I have a cramp I can’t paddle, and if I can’t
paddle we’ll upset, and if we upset—”</p>

<p>“You’ll get wet,” ended Jeffrey. “So I
guess we’ll let you and Jim take care of the
luncheon, Gil.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go if you’re going to put the luncheon
in his care,” declared Poke. “Why, there
wouldn’t be a smutch of it left by the time we
got to Riverbend. I insist on staying close to
the grub!”</p>

<p>“As close as you want, but in another boat,
sweet youth,” replied Gil. “Here’s Jim.
What did she say, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Which she? Lady says she will give us all
the lunch we want and Hope says she would
like to go very much indeed. To be quite exact,
fellows, she said it would be ‘perfectly jimmy!’”</p>

<small>UP THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were off at nine o’clock the next morning,
Jeffrey and Poke in one canoe and
Jim and Gil and Hope in another. The basket
of luncheon reposed between Jeffrey and Poke,
the latter declaring that it was needed as ballast.
Their canoe was not a very good one and
was the smaller of the two, and Poke had only
secured it, from two juniors who were in possession
of it when he arrived at the boat-house,
by his moving eloquence. It was a fine autumn
morning, warm and sunny, and it seemed that
the whole school had elected to spend the forenoon
on the river. For the first quarter of a
mile the stream was alive with canoes and
skiffs. Then the throng dwindled and soon the
voyagers had the river to themselves.</p>

<p>Poke was making hard work of paddling, although
all that Jeffrey required of him was
“push,” as he put it. “Just stick your blade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in, Poke, and push it back. I’ll look after the
steering.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” answered Poke, “but
I keep skinning my knuckles on the side of the
canoe.”</p>

<p>“Then put your left hand higher up on the
paddle,” Jeffrey laughed. “And when you
get tired, change over to the other side.”</p>

<p>“I’m not comfortable,” Poke grumbled
presently. “This thing you call a seat is as
hard as a rock. Why don’t they have cushions
in canoes?”</p>

<p>“Some do,” Jeffrey replied. “When I get
mine I’ll have a cushion especially for you,
Poke, with your initials on it.”</p>

<p>“Just as long as you don’t ask me to sit on
it, all right. I say, Gil, how are you getting
on?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, thank you. How are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fine! I guess I’m doing most of the
work from the feeling of my arms. Say,
wouldn’t it be great if the silly old river would
run the other way for awhile?”</p>

<p>“I wish there was another paddle,” said
Hope disconsolately. “I could help if there
were.”</p>

<p>“You’d upset the canoe if you tried to paddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
from the middle,” said Jim. “How much
further is it, Gil?”</p>

<p>“About a mile, I guess. Getting tired?”</p>

<p>“N-no; a little. It surely gets your muscles,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It surely does!” agreed Gil. “It’s getting
muscles I didn’t know I had!”</p>

<p>“Keep farther away,” warned Poke. “I
need lots of room when I paddle, and you make
me nervous when you come so close. Get out
or I’ll splash you, Gil!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you try it, son! And for goodness’
sake don’t wriggle around so in your seat. If
you upset we’ll lose the luncheon. I knew we
oughtn’t to have let you take it.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it most time for luncheon now?”
asked Poke. “We might just rest a while and
have a sandwich, eh?”</p>

<p>“Get out! It isn’t ten o’clock yet,” Gil
jeered.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” asked his chum pathetically.
“My arms feel as though it was twelve!”</p>

<p>“Rest awhile,” said Jeffrey from the stern.
“I can work it alone here. The current isn’t
so hard now.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll keep at it until I fall in a swoon,”
answered Poke. “One arm’s numb clear to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
elbow now and doesn’t hurt so much. I dare
say I’ll soon be beyond all pain.”</p>

<p>“Let’s paddle in to the bank,” Jim suggested,
“and take a rest. I’m just about all in,
fellows.”</p>

<p>So they turned the canoes to where the
branches of the trees overhung a little stretch
of pebbly beach and ran the bows of the craft
ashore. Poke laid his dripping paddle across
his knees, murmured “Good night!” and apparently
sank into slumber. They were all, excepting
Jeffrey and Hope, glad of the respite,
for paddling against the current, even for those
accustomed to it, is no light task. Hope wanted
to get out and “explore,” but her brother hard-heartedly
commanded her to sit still and not
overturn the canoe.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the river perfectly beautiful!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>There was a deep sigh from Poke. “It is
indeed paradise,” he murmured. Presently
he raised his head and looked about him, passing
a hand across his damp forehead. “Where
am I?” he asked dazedly. “Ah, I remember
all! I thought ’twas but a dream!”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we dream some more,”
laughed Jeffrey. “After we get to Riverbend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
we can rest as long as we want to. You fellows
ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, come on,” answered Jim. “Push her
off, Gil.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we going to have our luncheon
now?” asked Poke in injured surprise.
“Only the thought of food has kept me alive
thus far. Let’s every one have a sandwich,
fellows, just one miserable little sandwich.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, Poke,” said Gil. “Get a
move on. Jeff wants to buy his canoe some
time to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, just a half a sandwich,” pleaded
Poke. “Honest to goodness, fellows, I’m faint
with hunger and fatigue.”</p>

<p>“Shall I give him one?” asked Jeffrey
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Not a bite!” replied Gil. “He wouldn’t
do another stroke of work if you fed him now.
All he wants to do after he has eaten is lie down
and go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Gee, I want to do that now!” ejaculated
Poke, raising his paddle wearily and pushing
the bow of the canoe from the sand. “When
I fall in a dead faint in the bottom of the canoe
you fellows will be sorry you treated me so
meanly. Jeff, will you push the basket this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
way a little farther, please? I just want a
smell of it to encourage me!”</p>

<p>A half-mile farther up the stream they began
to encounter other crafts. Riverbend was a
veritable canoeing center and on fair days, and
especially on Saturdays and holidays, hundreds
of persons were to be found on the river thereabouts.
As early as it was, the stream was
pretty well populated as they drew near their
destination. There were red canoes and blue
canoes and white canoes and green canoes, and
canoes of half a dozen other colors or tints.
Many of them were really luxurious, with mahogany
seats and embroidered cushions, while
one craft that they passed, occupied by a man
and a woman, was floating lazily down the
stream with a graphophone playing in the bow.
That was too much for Poke. He stopped paddling
and stared at it most impolitely with open
mouth. Finally he shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he said discouragedly. “I
can’t do any more. My mind is wandering.
I’m seeing things and hearing music!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re just about there, I guess,”
laughed Jeffrey. “There’s a boat-house ahead
of us now, although I don’t know that it’s the
one we want.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will essay a few more faltering strokes
then,” replied Poke. “Shall you have one of
those music affairs in your canoe, Jeff, or are
you going to have a church organ?”</p>

<p>“A music box, I guess. There’s our place,
Poke; see the sign?”</p>

<p>Poke shook his head. “I see nothing
clearly,” he muttered. “All is a blur before
me.”</p>

<p>“There’s Sandford’s,” called Gil from the
other canoe which had drawn ahead. “Shall
we go over there now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s look at his canoes first. Then
we’ll have something to eat, eh?”</p>

<p>“Eat!” shouted Poke. “Who said eat?
Do my ears deceive me?”</p>

<p>“Back water!” commanded Jeffrey.
“That was a narrow squeak, Poke.” A pea-green
canoe crossed their bow, while the single
occupant of it asked them scathingly if they
were blind. It required some care to cross the
river, which here widened into a very respectable
basin, without scraping somebody’s paint,
but it was at last accomplished and the two
canoes sidled up to a long sloping float which
presented a very busy scene. Canoes were being
brought from their racks in the big shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and placed in the water, and dozens of persons
were embarking or awaiting their turns. Paddles
and cushions and lunch-boxes littered the
float. Through the open doors of the boat-house
canoe after canoe could be seen housed
on racks in the dim interior.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jim. “I didn’t
know there were so many canoes in the world!”</p>

<p>They pulled their own craft onto the float
and looked about them. Across the basin was
another boat-house bearing the name of a rival
maker. Near at hand a high bridge spanned
the river. Beyond it the stream turned to the
left and still more boat-houses showed through
the leafless trees that lined the banks.</p>

<p>“It’s just too—too jimmy for words!”
cried Hope. “It must be perfectly stunning up
here in summer, mustn’t it? Jim, will you
bring me up here sometime and paddle me
around?”</p>

<p>“We’ll all come up and make a day of it next
spring,” said Gil. “It’s really very jolly in
warm weather, when the leaves are out, you
know, and the birds are singing—”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” hooted Poke. “Listen to
old Gil rhapsodizing! ‘Trees and birds’!
Say, Gil, what you need is a bite to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s get busy, then,” said Jeffrey. “I
wonder where the office is.”</p>

<p>“At the other end,” said Poke. “I’ll show
you. Only—” He stopped and viewed the
luncheon basket thoughtfully. “Only,” he
went on, “I don’t want to take any chances
about losing that grub. Shall we take it with
us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, come ahead; no one’s going to steal it,”
said Gil. “Besides, if they do we can buy
luncheon here. There are two or three places
up there towards the station.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” responded Poke in relieved
tones. “Come on, then.”</p>

<p>Buying a canoe was not as easy as it had
seemed. Not that there was any scarcity of the
articles, however. That was just where the difficulty
lay. There were so many of them, new
and second hand, of all colors and sizes, that it
took a lot of deciding. Poke had been very
nearly right as to prices. In the end, after
fully a half hour of viewing and discussing,
Jeffrey made his decision. The canoe he
selected was sixteen feet long, with a white cedar
body and red cedar trim. It was painted crimson
and the varnish shone until the boys could
almost see their faces in it. It had been difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
at the last to choose between crimson and
blue in the matter of color, for the blue was a
most enticing shade. But Gil reminded Jeffrey
that crimson and gray were the school
colors and patriotism cast the deciding vote.
Then came the extras; paddles, seat-backs and
cushions. Jeffrey tried a half-dozen paddles
at the edge of the float before he decided on the
model he liked best and ordered two. One seat-back
was all he wanted, and that was only in
case Hope should honor the canoe with her
presence. Three cork cushions completed his
purchases and almost exhausted the fifty dollars
that he had brought with him. (The canoe
was thirty-seven dollars and a half.) Then
came the subject of having a name printed on
the bow, and Jeffrey was nonplussed.</p>

<p>“I think that would be nice, don’t you?” he
asked the others. They agreed that it would
and immediately suggested names. But none
of them seemed to please Jeffrey and finally
he told the man that they would think it over
and let him know about it in an hour or so.</p>

<p>“I suppose, though,” he said with a trace of
disappointment in his voice, “I’d have to wait
for it if you painted the name on.”</p>

<p>The man replied that it would require several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
days to perform the work and dry the
paint.</p>

<p>“That means that I’ll have to come up again
and get it, then.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir. We’ll deliver it for you at the
school. Just take it down with our launch.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I guess I’ll have a name on it,”
replied Jeffrey. “And I’ll let you know in
about an hour.”</p>

<p>So they left matters that way and went back
to their canoes for the luncheon basket. With
this in hand they started out to find a suitable
place to eat and at last succeeded, discovering
a sunny nook a little way down the river where
a row of willows shut them off from the observation
of the people in the passing canoes.
Mrs. Hazard had provided liberally. There
were sandwiches galore, tongue, ham and lettuce;
a thermos bottle filled with coffee that
was as hot when Hope poured it into the drinking
cups as when it had been put into the bottle;
another thermos filled with milk; a dozen
hard-boiled eggs; much cake and some bananas.
Poke heaved a sigh of contentment as
Hope and Jim spread the contents of the basket
out on two napkins.</p>

<p>“Great!” he said. “There’s as much as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
can eat there. I wonder, though, what the rest
of you are going to do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll show you in a minute,” said Gil.
“All gather around, ladies and gentlemen.
Who wants milk and who wants coffee?”</p>

<p>“I,” said Poke promptly.</p>

<p>“Well, which?”</p>

<p>“Both, please.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not get both. Which do you want,
Hope?”</p>

<p>“Milk, please. Have a sandwich, Poke?”</p>

<p>“<em>A</em> sandwich?” murmured Poke, helping
himself liberally after determining the kind he
wanted. “Why put the ‘a’ in?”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Jeffrey presently, when the
first pangs of hunger had been assuaged,
“let’s talk about a name for the canoe, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I help too?” asked Hope.</p>

<p>“Why, of course; I want you to!”</p>

<p>“You said ‘fellows,’ and I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” Jeffrey laughed, “I should
have said ‘Lady and fellows.’ I tell you how
we’ll do it. We’ll start and go around the
circle in turn. You’re first, Jim. What do
you say?”</p>

“I’m not much good at names.”</p>

<p>“All right. You’re next, Gil.”</p>

<p>“Well, how would ‘Crofton’ do?”</p>

said Jeff. “What do you say, Hope?”</p>

<p>“Now, Poke.”</p>

<p>“‘Tippy,’” replied Poke promptly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t tippy,” denied Jeff.</p>

<p>“All canoes are tippy. Call this one ‘Tippi-canoe,’
only call it ‘Tippy’ for short. Get
me?”</p>

<p>There was a groan of disapproval and Jeffrey
looked at Jim.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jim. “I think what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Hope suggested is pretty good. Or you might
call it ‘Kingfisher.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jeffrey, “or ‘Lotus.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, or ‘Pink Carnation,’” jeered Poke.
“Or ‘Canary Bird.’ Why don’t you think of
something appropriate? Now, ‘Tippy’—”</p>

<p>“Is idiotic,” interrupted Gil. “I think you
need a short name, Jeff; something with ‘go’ to
it—”</p>

<p>“That’s it!” exclaimed Jim, almost upsetting
his coffee cup.</p>

<p>“What’s it?” they asked.</p>

<p>“‘Go To It’!”</p>

<p>“Really, that’s not bad,” commented Poke.</p>

<p>The others agreed, all save Hope. Hope said
she thought it was a bit slangy.</p>

<p>“But that’s the kind of name you want,”
insisted Gil. “Something snappy, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Why not call it ‘Poke’?” asked that
youth.</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘Slow Poke,’” amended Jim. “But
I don’t call that snappy. What’s the matter
with something Indian?”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket!” cried Poke. “Jimmy,
old boy, you’re coming on. Let’s call it
‘Laughing Water.’”</p>

<p>“Or ‘Minnehaha.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or ‘Silver Heels.’”</p>

<p>“‘Rain-in-the-Face!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out, Poke! Be sensible.” This
from Gil. “I guess all the Indian names have
been used up, Jeff. Why not call it ‘Hope’?”</p>

<p>Hope laughed merrily at that, and Poke
grinned. “I wish you would,” he said
eagerly. “You certainly would get your
share of joshing, Senator.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s getting on, fellows, and we don’t
seem to have found anything very good yet.
Can’t any one think of anything?”</p>

<p>There was a depressed silence until Jim said
feebly: “Call it ‘Noname.’” This met with
the reception it deserved. Hope knitted her
brows and forgot, in her absorption, to finish
the slice of cake she held. Finally Poke broke
the stillness. “Who’s got a pencil?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Give it back?” inquired Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” replied Poke, viewing it
in disgust. “Now who’s got a piece of paper?”</p>

<p>“Any other little thing you’d like?” asked
Gil, tossing him a box-lid. “A twenty-dollar
gold piece or a silk hat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like silence,” said Poke severely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
He began to write on the lid and the others,
glad of a respite from thinking, watched him
curiously. For a minute Poke scribbled and
erased and frowned, but finally a satisfied smile
dawned over his countenance.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” he announced. “Gil said all
the Indian names had been used, my friends,
but Gil, as usual, was wrong. Here, Jeff, is
the name of your canoe.”</p>

<p>He tossed the box-lid to Jeffrey. On it he
had printed in big letters:</p>

<p class="noic">MI-KA-NOO.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” asked Jeffrey. Then
it dawned on him and he burst into a laugh and
handed the inscription on to Jim. “That’s
bully, Poke! It really does look like Indian at
first, too!”</p>

<p>“My Canoe,” Jim translated as he passed it
on. “How did you think of it, Poke?”</p>

<p>Poke waved his hand airily, signifying that
the thing was too trivial to be worth attention.</p>

<p>“The only thing,” said Gil, with a grin, “is
that you’re pretty sure to call it ‘Mike’ for
short.”</p>

<p>“Great!” laughed Jim. “You wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
something short and snappy and there it is;
Mike. You can’t beat it.”</p>

<p>Hope was less enthusiastic about the name
than the others, and said she thought it would
be a shame to call anything as pretty as the
crimson canoe, “Mike,” but Jeffrey was delighted
with the suggestion. “It will look
bully when it’s painted on,” he declared. “I
suppose they’ll do it in gold, won’t they, Gil?”</p>

<p>“If you tell them to they will, I guess. Let’s
get a move on, or we won’t get home before
the game begins. Toss me another banana,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“How many have you had already?” asked
his chum severely.</p>

<p>“Only one; honest.”</p>

<p>“All right; catch. Who wants some more
cake? There are three bananas left, too.
Have one, Jim? Any one else in the audience
like a banana? Shove the basket over, Hope,
and I’ll dump these things in. What time is
it?”</p>

<p>“After twelve,” replied Gil. “We’ll have
to hurry a bit.”</p>

<p>“It won’t take us twenty minutes to get back
after we’re started,” said Jeffrey. “We’ve
got the current with us, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is indeed painful news,” grunted
Poke. “I hoped to be able to paddle back.”</p>

<p>“Jeff,” asked Hope as they retraced their
steps, “will you teach me to paddle sometime?
I’d love to know how. It isn’t hard, is it? It
doesn’t look hard, anyway.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t hard, except when you’re going
against the stream or the wind,” Jeffrey answered.
“I’ll show you how any day you like
after I get ‘Mike.’”</p>

<p>Hope made a face. “I think that’s a perfectly—perfectly
suggy name, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Suggy? What’s suggy?”</p>

<p>“Horrid, of course.”</p>

<p>“I see; the antonym of jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” replied Hope. “I don’t believe
I know what an-an-anto—what that is,
though.”</p>

<p>They returned to the float, and while Jeffrey
and Gil went on to the office to see about
having the name put on the canoe, Jim and
Poke launched the craft and made ready for
the return trip. Then, as the others had not
come back, Poke excused himself with the vague
explanation that he thought he’d just look
around a minute, and disappeared up the hill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Jeffrey and Gil returned presently and after
they had waited several minutes for Poke that
young gentleman sauntered into sight with a
huge bag of peanuts from which he was industriously
eating.</p>

<p>“Pig!” shouted Gil scathingly.</p>

<p>“For that,” remarked Poke tranquilly,
“you get none, my friend. Who wants some
peanuts?”</p>

<p>It seemed that they all did, for Gil and Jim
captured the bag by main force and made an
equal distribution of its contents. As Jim remarked
a few minutes later, it was a lucky
thing that they did not have to paddle going
back, for paddling would have interfered seriously
with eating the peanuts. As it was, they
left a floating trail of shells all the way from
Riverbend to the boat-house at Crofton.</p>

<p>Jeffrey and Hope returned to Sunnywood,
but the others remained at school to await
the time for the game with St. Luke’s Academy.
Poke declared that Jeffrey was going home to
get more dinner, and showed a strong disposition
to accompany him. Gil and Jim, however,
restrained him by force of arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want anything myself,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
said, “but some one ought to go along and see
that those two don’t get any more. My—my
motive, Gil, was quite disinterested.”</p>

<p>“You’re coming back to see the game, aren’t
you, Jeff?” called Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. So is Hope. And we’re going
to bring Lady if she will come,” answered
Jeffrey.</p>

<p>The three seated themselves on the steps of
the gymnasium and watched Jeffrey go swinging
along with the aid of his crutches, Hope beside
him suiting her steps to his.</p>

<p>“He gets along mighty well, doesn’t he?”
observed Gil. “Gee, if I was in his shoes, fellows,
I’d have a grouch all the time. Think
of knowing that you’ve got to go through life
like that! Br-r-r!”</p>

<p>“Think of not being able to play football or
tennis or any of the things we do,” said Poke
soberly. “That’s what would get me, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“He certainly can handle a canoe, though,”
said Jim.</p>

<p>“And he told me last night that he could
swim,” Gil added. “In fact he seemed to
think he could do that about as well as I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should hope so!” exclaimed Poke.
“You’re a punk swimmer.”</p>

<p>“Am I? I noticed that I had no trouble
swimming all around you last summer, Pokey.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! I wasn’t well that day. You
know I’d eaten too much breakfast.”</p>

<p>“You usually do,” replied Gil sweetly. “I
suppose you can swim like a fish, Jim?”</p>

<p>“N-no, I can’t swim much; I mean I can’t
do many fancy tricks like fellows I’ve seen. I
can keep it up a long time, though. I swam six
miles one day last summer.”</p>

<p>“Six miles!” Poke whistled expressively.
“What for?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; just to see if I could.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you dead when you got through?”</p>

<p>“A little tired; not much. I swam out to
the island first; that’s nearly a mile; and then
I went to the breakwater, which is a good two
miles, and then back the same way. It makes
a good swim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Poke carelessly, “but a
trifle short; what? Did you rest any?”</p>

<p>“No, not to speak of. I stayed in the water
all the time, but I rested a couple of minutes at
the island and about as long as that at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
of the breakwater. I didn’t stop at all coming
back.”</p>

<p>“Where’s this place you live?” asked Gil.
“Near here, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just over there.” Jim nodded in the
general direction of the coast. “Only about
thirty miles. Essexport, you know.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of it. Folks go there in summer,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>“Some, but it isn’t a fashionable summer resort
at all. A good many artists go there.
You stumble over them all the time on the
wharves and around the harbor. They sit
under white umbrellas and paint any old thing
they can find. They’re rather nice folks,
artists.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would be fun,” said Poke
vaguely. “Are you going home in the summer?”</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. “I don’t know. You
see, we’ve rented our house. We might go
back for a little while, I suppose. I dare say
it’s pretty hot here in summer.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it is!” said Gil. “It was so hot
last spring at commencement that we nearly
died. Had to dress up in our best togs, you
know, and make a hit with our relatives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“And other fellows’ relatives,” growled
Poke. “I nearly danced my poor little heart
out that night, Gil. It was my fatal fascination,
Jim. The girls simply <em>had</em> to have a
dance with me!”</p>

<p>“Dance!” scoffed Gil. “You don’t call
what you do dancing, do you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do,” replied Poke with dignity.
“It is the poetry of motion. Gil is envious,”
he explained, turning to Jim. “He dances
like a trained bear on the end of a chain. Ever
see one? Like this.” And Poke began to revolve
around and around on the landing in ludicrous
imitation of a bear. Even Gil had to
laugh at the performance. Then Poke declared
that he had to have a drink of water and
they sauntered over to Memorial, meeting a
few late diners on the way. After that it was
almost time to think of dressing for the game,
and they returned to the gymnasium, loitered
awhile on the steps and then descended to the
locker-room and leisurely got into their togs.</p>

<small>MR. HANKS AS A NOVELIST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jeffrey and Hope failed in their plan to
entice Mrs. Hazard to the game that afternoon.
When they reached Sunnywood dinner
was just over and Mrs. Hazard and Mr. Hanks
were coming from the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Did you have a nice time, dear?” asked
Hope’s mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, just scrumptious!” Hope answered.
“And Jeff bought the darlingest, jimmiest
canoe you ever saw! And its name is ‘Mi-Ka-Noo.’
And Jeff is going to teach me to
paddle, aren’t you, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“If Lady doesn’t mind,” replied Jeff. “Do
you like canoeing, sir?” he asked, turning to
Mr. Hanks, who, during the conversation had
been surreptitiously striving to edge his way
past the group and reach the stairway.</p>

<p>“I—I have never tried it, Latham. But
isn’t it—er—a bit unsafe? I’ve always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
understood that canoes were—er—very unstable
boats.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have to be careful in them,” Jeffrey
allowed. “But they’re not quite as bad
as folks try to make out. As long as you can
swim there’s no danger, sir.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not; no, not so long as you can—er—swim.
I regret to say that swimming is
an accomplishment I have never mastered.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about this canoeing,” said
Mrs. Hazard doubtfully. “Hope can swim a
little, but—”</p>

<p>“Why, Lady, you know I can swim beautifully!
I swam seventy-five strokes last summer!”</p>

<p>“Well, that would be enough to take you
ashore anywhere on this river,” laughed Jeffrey.
“I don’t think you need be alarmed,
Lady. I’ll be very careful of her.”</p>

<p>“But—but can you swim all right yourself,
Latham?” asked Mr. Hanks.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I get along better in the water
than I do on land.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you can go, then, if you
want to very much,” said Mrs. Hazard. “But
do be careful; and sit very quiet. Are you going
this afternoon?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, Lady. Jeff hasn’t got it yet; not
until next week. He’s having the name painted
on it. This afternoon we’re going to the football
game. We’re all going, aren’t we?” She
turned questioningly to the instructor.
“You are coming with us, aren’t you, Mr.
Hanks?”</p>

<p>“Er—why, thank you,” he stammered,
“but I have so much to attend to, Miss Hope.
I—I think I won’t go. Much obliged. I—I
must really get back to my work.” He moved
toward the stairway, nodded embarrassedly
and disappeared up the stairs.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re coming, aren’t you?” Hope
demanded of her mother. But Mrs. Hazard
shook her head smilingly.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, dear. I’ve too much to do.
I’ve told Jane she might go to the village and do
some shopping, and—”</p>

<p>“Then I shall stay at home and help you,”
declared Hope cheerfully. “You won’t mind,
will you, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Jeff will mind!” said Mrs. Hazard
laughingly. “He will mind terribly! And,
besides, my dear, I don’t need you a bit. So run
along and don’t be late.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots of time,” said Hope. “Are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
you quite, <em>quite</em> sure there’s nothing I can do,
Lady?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure. So you go and see the football.
Did you have luncheon enough? Don’t
you want something now?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, we had plenty,” replied Jeffrey.
“In fact, we didn’t eat quite all of it.”</p>

<p>“We had a lot of peanuts, too,” laughed
Hope. “Poke bought them, and Jim and Gil
took them away from him and we all ate them
coming home. And, Lady, it’s perfectly beautiful
at Riverbend, and we saw thousands and
thousands of canoes, and—”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a great many?” asked her
mother smilingly.</p>

<p>“Well, not thousands, but hundreds, Lady.
We did see hundreds, didn’t we, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s say dozens, Hope, and be on
the safe side,” Jeff replied with a laugh.
“Sometime I’d like you and Hope to let me
take you up there in the canoe, Lady, and show
you how pretty it is. Sometime in the spring
would be best, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I should love to go,” replied Mrs. Hazard,
“but I’ll have to learn to swim first. Now run
along to your football game. Is Jim going to
play to-day, Jeff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I think not. At least, I’m
afraid he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was afraid he was,” Mrs. Hazard
laughed. “It’s all in the point of view, isn’t
it? Do you think you ought to walk so much,
Jeff? You must be careful and not get too
tired.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind it. It’s just my shoulders
that get sort of tired sometimes, but they soon
feel all right again. I think I’ll go up and put
some decent clothes on, Hope. It won’t take
me very long.”</p>

<p>“And I’m going to do the same,” Hope replied.
“And it will take me a full half-hour.
So you needn’t hurry. We’ve got plenty of
time, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Over an hour,” Jeffrey replied. “So you
can just doll yourself all up, Hope.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he use awful language, Lady?”
asked Hope. “I’d be ashamed if I were a
senator’s son, wouldn’t you? I’ll be all ready
in just exactly half an hour, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll be waiting for you.”</p>

<p>When he reached the head of the stairs he
noticed that Mr. Hanks’ door was partly open.
It was usually closed tight when the instructor
was inside, and Jeffrey wondered. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
wondered more a moment later when the sound
of quick, nervous footsteps reached him. He
paused a moment and listened. Back and
forth paced Mr. Hanks, the length of the room,
the tail of his coat appearing at the opening of
the door each time as he turned.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” reflected Jeffrey, “what the
trouble is with Nancy. He sounds like a caged
lion. I guess somebody must have turned in
some pretty bad papers. Hope it wasn’t me!”</p>

<p>True to her promise, Hope was ready at the
end of the half-hour, looking very neat and
pretty in her blue dress. Jeffrey had changed
his old clothes for a suit of dark gray, and they
were a very nice-looking pair of youngsters as
they left the cottage. Jeffrey said something
complimentary about Hope’s gown, and Hope
smiled demurely down at its trim folds.</p>

<p>“It is nice, isn’t it?” she asked. “I like
blue better than any other color. I suppose I
ought to like crimson, oughtn’t I? Because
that’s the Crofton color. But I couldn’t wear
crimson, could I? Not with yellow hair.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” laughed Jeffrey, “you’ll
make an awful hit with the St. Luke’s fellows.
Their color’s blue, you see.”</p>

<p>“Not really, Jeff?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded. “Of course, their shade of blue
isn’t like your dress, but they’ll know you’re
for them, Hope.”</p>

<p>Hope tossed her head. “They’ll know nothing
of the sort. I shall borrow somebody’s
flag and tie it around my neck! They won’t
beat us, will they?”</p>

<p>“St. Luke’s? I don’t think so, but you can’t
tell. Gil says we’re going to have a rattling
good game, so I suppose that means that it
will be a close one.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I don’t care how close it is as
long as we win. That Gary boy can’t play to-day,
can he?”</p>

<p>“No, not for a good many days. He fixed
himself for awhile, I guess. Wasn’t Mr.
Hanks funny when you asked him to go with
us? I thought he was going to fall in a faint.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why, do you? It would do him
good to get out of doors and forget his silly work
now and then.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would. When I went upstairs
he was walking back and forth in his room just
like a lion in a cage at the zoo. I guess something
must be troubling him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,” said Hope. “He
often does that. You can hear him in the dining-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
when you’re setting table or something.
He does it sometimes for ten or fifteen minutes,
and then he’s as quiet as a mouse for hours and
hours! I suppose it’s his writing, Jeff. He—he
is seeking inspiration.”</p>

<p>“I hope he finds it before your carpet is
worn out!” Jeffrey laughed. “I wonder
what he is writing, Hope.”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a book,” said Hope.</p>

<p>“What kind of a book?”</p>

<p>Hope shook her head. “I don’t know. Perhaps—perhaps
it’s a novel, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“A novel! Fancy Nancy Hanks writing a
novel!” Jeffrey laughed at the thought of it.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not,” Hope demurred. “I
think he’s awfully smart, Jeff, don’t you?
Don’t you think he knows a terrible lot?”</p>

<p>“Y-es, I suppose he does, only—only he
doesn’t look like a novelist, does he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Sir Walter Scott looked much
like a novelist, but he was one. And—and
I don’t suppose all novelists can look the same,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. But I’ll bet you that book
of his is some sort of a history or a Latin text-book.
Why, Nancy wouldn’t waste his time on
anything as—as flippant as a novel, Hope!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think novels are flippant,” Hope replied
rather indignantly. “You don’t call
Ivanhoe and David Copperfield and—and all
those flippant, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, but I wasn’t thinking of that sort of
novels. If that’s what he’s doing—”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell. He might be. If he is I
do hope he will tell us about it when it’s done.
Wouldn’t you like to read it, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I dare say. Anyhow, I know
mighty well I’d rather read it than any old
Latin book he could write!”</p>

<p>They found the grand-stand well filled when
they reached the field, and after securing seats
they had to wait but a minute or two before the
visiting team appeared. Hope was relieved to
find that the St. Luke’s blue was a very light
shade of the color, although Jeffrey gravely assured
her that blue was blue and that St. Luke’s
wouldn’t mind if she didn’t wear the exact
shade.</p>

<p>“There’s Brandon Gary over there,” said
Jeffrey sotto voce as he indicated the direction
with his glance. “I should think he’d feel
pretty mean to be sitting up there not able to
play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is the nice-looking boy this side of
him?” asked Hope. “The one leaning forward.”</p>

<p>“Joe Cosgrove. He’s baseball captain, you
know. He is nice looking, isn’t he? They say
he’s a dandy player.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care much for baseball, do you?”
said Hope.</p>

<p>“Crazy about it.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t like it as well as football,
Jeff?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I think I do. Perhaps one
reason is that a fellow can see a baseball game
and not freeze to death or get soaking wet.
Still, come to think of it, I did get pretty well
drenched once at a baseball game. I’d rather
see a boat race, though, than either.”</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen one,” said Hope. “Not a
rowing race, I mean. I’ve watched lots of
yacht races, but I never can make out which
boat is ahead. There are always so many of
them. And lots and lots of them aren’t racing
at all; just following; and I never know which is
which. I suppose a rowing race isn’t like that,
though.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. I’m going to try for the crew in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the spring, but I don’t suppose I’ll make it.
Anyhow, it’s fun trying, and I love to row.
Here comes our fellows, Hope.”</p>

<p>The cheer leaders were on their feet and in an
instant the sharp cheer rattled out; <em>Crow, crow,
crow, Crofton! Crow, crow, crow, Crofton!
Crow, crow, crow, Crofton! Crofton! Crofton!</em>
Then came a cheer for St. Luke’s, and a moment
after some thirty devoted sons of that alma
mater gathered together across the field and
returned the compliment, making up in vigor
what they lacked in numbers. Then Crofton
lined her warriors across the gridiron, St.
Luke’s scattered her defense over the opposite
territory and Duncan Sargent kicked off.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE GAME WITH ST. LUKE’S</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">That kick-off was a fizzle. St. Luke’s got
the ball on her twenty-five yards, ran it
back ten and then her full-back broke through
the Crofton left side for twenty yards, and
there was great joy where the handful of St.
Luke’s supporters were gathered. After two
tries had yielded but four yards the St. Luke’s
captain and left half-back kicked to Arnold on
Crofton’s fifteen-yard line. A very considerable
little wind had come up since noon and it
lengthened the kick. Arnold ran back fifteen
yards before he was downed. Two plays were
tried and Crofton was penalized for starting
before the ball. After Arnold had broken
through the center for four yards he kicked and
a moment later the St. Luke’s captain started
the Blue’s rooters again by tearing off a fifteen-yard
run through center on a delayed pass.
On the next play a St. Luke’s back fumbled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
LaGrange recovered the pigskin, for the Crimson-and-Gray.</p>

<p>Poke beat off nine yards at St. Luke’s left
end and Arnold followed with a plunge of five
yards through the middle. Smith then failed
to gain, and Arnold got off a poor punt which
the St. Luke’s right end captured. On the
first play the Blue’s quarter-back tried for distance
through the Crofton center, only to
fumble and have Benson of Crofton recover the
ball.</p>

<p>Arnold kicked, and as Gil was interfered with,
the ball was brought back and Crofton was presented
with ten yards. On the next play Arnold
made five yards, and then Poke shaking
off his opponents, ran thirty-seven yards, placing
the ball within ten yards of the St. Luke’s
goal line. Smith tried to gain on the right of
the Blue’s line but failed, and a forward pass,
Arnold to Poke, was intercepted by the St.
Luke’s captain on his own four-yard line. He
scampered and dodged back to his ten-yard line
before he was brought down, with half the
Crofton team sitting on and about him. On
the first play the Blue’s captain fumbled while
going through the line and Duncan Sargent
grabbed the ball for Crofton on the nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
yards. Two plays by Arnold and Poke netted
seven yards. Then, with Arnold back, a forward
pass, Arnold throwing the ball to Poke,
brought the first score. Poke caught the ball
on the twelve-yard line and scampered over the
last white mark before he was pulled down.
The punt-out was a failure, the ball striking the
ground.</p>

<p>But Crofton cheered and made known her approval.
The playing for the rest of the first
period was in the middle of the field, although
at one time Arnold was forced to punt from behind
Crofton’s goal line, after a mess had been
made of the handling of one of the blue captain’s
kicks. The quarter ended with the ball
in St. Luke’s possession on her own forty-six-yard
line.</p>

<p>In the second period St. Luke’s was on the
defensive. Fumbles enabled Crofton to get the
pigskin to within twenty-five yards of St. Luke’s
goal line, where Benson, on a forward pass,
ran over the goal line, only to be called back
because Poke had held an opponent. Some two
minutes later the period ended and the teams
trotted off.</p>

<p>“The teams are pretty evenly matched,”
said Jeffrey, “and Gil was right about it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a stiff game. I guess we’re a little heavier
than they are, and I think our offense is better.
One thing is certain, though, and that is
that we’re away ahead of them at handling the
ball. They made some awful fumbles in that
last quarter, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it helped us, Jeff. I don’t see why
that mean old thing of a referee wouldn’t let
us have that last touchdown. Do you think
that was fair?”</p>

<p>“Of course it was,” Jeffrey laughed.
“Poke was holding one of the St. Luke’s fellows
and the officials caught him. So we got
penalized and lost our touchdown. Too bad,
too, for that was a corking pass, and Benson
handled it finely. There wasn’t a soul near him
when he got the ball.”</p>

<p>“Then it was Poke’s fault?” asked Hope
sadly.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it was. I don’t suppose he
meant to hold. A fellow gets excited and
doesn’t realize sometimes. I guess Poke feels
as badly as anybody about it. But never mind,
we’ll trim them all right. We should get at
least one more touchdown in the next two
periods.”</p>

<p>“I hope we get a dozen,” declared Hope.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
“And wasn’t that run of Poke’s perfectly jimmy?
I guess we can forgive him for losing us
that other touchdown, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, especially as he made the first one. I
wonder if Johnny will put in any substitutes
now.”</p>

<p>“I wish he’d let Jim play,” said Hope.</p>

<p>“Jim may make the team yet,” replied Jeffrey.
“Cosgrove is playing a mighty good
game in Gary’s place, by the way. I wonder
what Gary is thinking about it. Here they
come again. Now let’s see. No, the team’s
just the same, I guess.”</p>

<p>Crofton was on the defensive throughout the
whole of the third period, the St. Luke’s captain
having ordained it so when his long kick
rolled to Crofton’s twenty-yard line before Arnold
recovered it. It was then that the Blue’s
supporters took heart, and from across the gridiron
came cheer after cheer as St. Luke’s
worked the ball by a series of plays in which
three successful forward passes figured down
to within eight yards of the Crofton goal line.
St. Luke’s looked really dangerous for the first
time and on the Crofton side of the field her
supporters watched uneasily as the St. Luke’s
backs settled for the next play. It was another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
forward pass and a sigh of relief went up
from the Crimson-and-Gray as the ball was
fumbled and went to Crofton as a touchback.
Out to the twenty-five yards went the ball and
Crofton put it in scrimmage. St. Luke’s made
several other attempts in that period to get
across her opponent’s goal line, but never again
secured such another chance as the one she had
wasted.</p>

<p>The last quarter found Crofton forcing the
playing and St. Luke’s again on the defensive.
Arnold tried a goal from placement from the
Blue’s forty-yard line, but the ball went wide
of the posts. St. Luke’s chose to kick from
behind the twenty-five-yard line, but it was not
long before Crofton had the ball back in the
Blue’s territory. Failure to gain ground at
rushing caused Arnold to punt, and a substitute
left half-back who had taken the place of the
Blue’s captain a moment before, muffed the
ball. LaGrange fell on it for Crofton on St.
Luke’s ten-yard line, and before St. Luke’s
realized what had happened Poke tossed the
pigskin on a forward pass to Gil at left end and
the second touchdown was made. This time
Sargent kicked the goal and Crofton’s score was
11. For the remainder of the contest the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
hovered about the middle of the gridiron, St.
Luke’s, recognizing defeat, being content to
keep her opponent from approaching her goal
line again.</p>

<p>It had been a good game from a Crofton
point of view, and, to quote Hope, a “perfectly
jimmy” one for Sunnywood. Poke and Gil had
played finely and had scored the only touchdowns
that had been made. But it was Poke’s
work especially that brought them joy and sent
the whole school away in a glow of enthusiasm.
He had been far and away the most spectacular
performer of the afternoon. He had contributed
the best individual work in carrying the
ball, once having made a run of thirty-seven
yards at St. Luke’s left end, and, later, one of
forty-five yards around the enemy’s right end.
Whether on the directing or the receiving end
of the forward pass, he had been excellent.
Crofton’s first score had been made with Poke
on the receiving end, while the second score had
been the result of his accurate throw to Gil.</p>

<p>Arnold, too, however, was a hero that day.
The quarter-back had used the best of judgment
in the selection of plays, while at ground gaining
he had performed well. Several times he
had torn through the St. Luke’s center for good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
distances. His punting also had been good and
the enemy’s backs had found a great deal of
difficulty in handling his kicks. LaGrange at
center had shown a wonderful nose for the ball,
and his recovery of the pigskin which opened
the way for the second touchdown had been a
fine effort. Gil at end, Benson at full-back,
Sargent at left guard and Smith at left half-back
all distinguished themselves that day. On
the whole Crofton went home from the game
very well satisfied with her team. Even Johnny’s
countenance gave one the impression that
he was pleased. And he was. The only place
that was worrying the coach was the position of
left tackle. Marshall had not been up to the
rest of the line that day, and it was becoming
more and more evident that a better man must
be found for his place.</p>

<p>There was great pride and much rejoicing at
Sunnywood that Saturday night. Hope, could
she have had her way, would, I am certain, have
crowned Poke and Gil with wreaths of laurel!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>GARY CHALLENGES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The canoe came on Wednesday. Of course
by this time, as Gil had predicted, its
name had been shortened to “Mike,” which
was a very plebeian title for such a handsome
craft. It was quite the best looking canoe in
the school boat-house, although Brandon Gary
and “Punk” Gibbs owned between them a craft
that, when new, had been a marvel of white and
gold. Now it was pretty well scratched and
battered, and there were palpable patches showing
along the bottom. Jeffrey was properly
proud of his new possession, and spent most of
Wednesday afternoon in or about it. It paddled
beautifully, he decided, sat well on the
water and was altogether a treasure. He paddled
far down the river in the Mi-Ka-Noo and
worked back in the golden glory of an autumn
sunset, with the afterglow tingeing the surface
of the little stream with coppery lights and the
blade of his paddle trickling golden drops as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hung between strokes above the placid surface.
In the boat-house he found an empty rack and
saw the canoe carefully laid away on it, holding
his breath for fear the boatman might mar
the glistening varnish of its sides.</p>

<p>The next forenoon he and Poke hurried down
to the boat-house between recitations. Sammy,
the boatman, left his bench in the repair shop
and lifted the Mi-Ka-Noo into the water for
them. Jeffrey got into the stern and Poke settled
himself in the bow and they started up-river.
Poke was eager now to learn how to
paddle and so there was a ten-minute lesson.
By the time they had dropped Biscuit Island
from sight he was doing very well, although he
had not yet mastered the twist of the paddle at
the end of the stroke. Jeffrey, however, kept
the canoe in its course and Poke persevered in
his efforts to “get the hang of it,” as he said.
Half a mile up-stream Jeffrey called a halt and
they pulled the canoe in under the branches of
the trees and rested awhile, Poke ascertaining,
by a glance at his watch, that they still had a
full half-hour before them.</p>

<p>“It’s funny how it tires your shoulders,” said
Poke, as he dropped his watch back. “I believe
I can get onto it all right, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course you can,” Jeffrey responded.
“There’s no trick to it. It’s just a hard,
steady drive and then a half-turn of the blade
before you take it out.”</p>

<p>“I know, but it’s that half-turn that puzzles
me. I get it sometimes, and then the next
time I almost lose my paddle.”</p>

<p>“Want to try the stern going back?”</p>

<p>But Poke shook his head. “I don’t think
I’d better yet. I might put Mike onto the bank
or into a snag. Here’s some one coming up.
Looks like Bull Gary. Not only looks, but is.
And Gibbs with him.”</p>

<p>They watched the white canoe approach,
drawing the bow of their own canoe further toward
shore, for the stream was narrow here
and Jeffrey wasn’t going to risk his paint.
Gary was paddling in the stern and Punk
Gibbs was in the bow. Gary recognized Poke
when some distance away and waved his paddle
to him. Poke waved back, and when the
white craft was within speaking distance Poke
called:</p>

<p>“Hello, Bull! Hello, Punk! That the same
old mud-scow you used to have?”</p>

<p>Gary turned his canoe toward the opposite
side, Gibbs seized a branch and they came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a pause. Gary laid his paddle across his knees,
said “Phew!” eloquently and grinned at Poke.</p>

<p>“Yes, same old mud-scow,” he said.
“Where’d you get that thing, Poke? It looks
like a fire-engine. Did they have any red paint
left?”</p>

<p>“This,” replied Poke, “belongs to Latham.
You know Latham, don’t you, Bull? Latham’s
the chap who has the room you liked the looks
of, Bull. Jeff, the other gentlemen is Mr.
Gibbs. Punk is all right, but he’s terribly careless
about the company he keeps. What do you
think of this for some canoe, Punk?”</p>

<p>“She’s a peach,” replied Gibbs admiringly.
“Where did you get her, Latham?”</p>

<p>“Sandford’s,” answered Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“How do you pronounce that name?” asked
Gary, who had been frowning at it for a minute.
Poke told him and the frown vanished. Gary
chuckled. “Pretty good, eh, Punk? Mi-Ka-Noo!
I thought it was some Indian gibberish.”</p>

<p>“Go pretty well?” asked Gibbs.</p>

<p>“Like a breeze,” replied Poke. “She paddles
herself. Fastest thing on the river except
the varsity shell!”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you this old tub can run rings
around her,” grunted Gary. “Even if she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
two years old and has forty-eleven patches on
her!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s been a good canoe in its day,”
answered Poke airily. “But they’re making
’em better now, Bull. Look at the lines on this
old top. Pretty neat, what?”</p>

<p>“Too broad,” said Gary. “She’s built for
comfort but not speed, Poke.”</p>

<p>“Speed! Why, this canoe has the Empire
State Express spiked to the rails! Speed!
Honestly, Bull, you pain me.”</p>

<p>Gary grinned. “We’ll race you back to the
boat-house,” he offered. “If we don’t beat
you by half a dozen lengths I—I’ll—”</p>

<p>“Apologize,” suggested Poke. “We accept
your challenge, sir.”</p>

<p>“But, Poke,” said Jeffrey, “they’re bound
to beat us.”</p>

<p>“Of course we are,” Gary laughed. “Latham’s
got a lot more sense than you have,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“He is thinking of the fact that I am a very
poor canoedler,” said Poke. “This is only the
second time I’ve ever tried it. But that doesn’t
matter because, as I have previously remarked,
Bull, this canoe paddles herself. Turn your old
derelict around and get ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you want me to take the stern?”
asked Gibbs. “You paddled all the way up.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, I’m not tired,” answered Gary.
“Let the bow come around.”</p>

<p>“Right-O!” cried Poke as the two canoes lay
side by side. “Give the word, Bull.”</p>

<p>“All right. Are you ready? ... Go!”</p>

<p>Off they went, all four paddles digging hard.
Poke was apparently trying to lift the bow of
the Mi-Ka-Noo out of the water in his wild efforts,
and Jeffrey called to him to slow down.</p>

<p>“Longer strokes, Poke, and make them tell!
That’s it!”</p>

<p>For a moment during that first excited spurt
the two canoes were in danger of colliding, but
Jeffrey managed to swing away and in that instant
the white canoe gained a slight lead.</p>

<p>In some places the channel was scarcely wide
enough to allow the two canoes to travel side
by side, since there were many snags along the
banks. And so when the white canoe took the
lead Jeffrey was content to let it keep it until
they had passed the next turn and the channel
widened. But the Mi-Ka-Noo hung close to
the stern of the other craft in spite of Gary’s
strenuous paddling, and presently, when the
boat-house came into sight ahead, Jeffrey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
passed the word and slowly the Mi-Ka-Noo
crept up foot by foot until it was even with its
competitor.</p>

<p>Poke was not yet a scientific paddler, but he
had plenty of muscle, meant to beat Gary if
such a thing were possible and so toiled like a
hero in the bow. At the stern Jeffrey’s experience
made up for the fact that he hadn’t the
strength to put into the strokes that Gary had.
But it was, I think, the Mi-Ka-Noo that won
its own race, for the crimson canoe was undoubtedly
faster than the white one. Some
fifty yards from the boat-house float the Mi-Ka-Noo’s
curving prow drew away from the
rival craft. Then Jeffrey, crouching at the
stern, was even with the center of the white
canoe, and Gary, paddling madly and grunting
with every stroke of his flashing blade, called
on Gibbs for a spurt.</p>

<p>“Come on, Punk! Get into it! Make her
go!”</p>

<p>Gibbs tried his best, but his strokes when they
grew faster grew also weaker, and the crimson
canoe gained steadily until there was open
water between her stern and the white bow.</p>

<p>“Not too fast!” warned Jeffrey. “Make
them hard, Poke!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>And Poke, who was getting excited by the
prospect of victory, steadied down again. Then
Gibbs “caught a crab” with his paddle, Gary
lost his temper and called him names and the
Mi-Ka-Noo shot past the float a good length
and a half ahead!</p>

<p>Poke subsided over his paddle and fought for
breath while Jeffrey, backing water and paddling,
turned the canoe about and went back to
the float.</p>

<p>“I guess this one’s a bit faster than yours,
Gary,” said Jeffrey. “She sits out of the
water more, I think.”</p>

<p>But strangely enough Gary had an affection
for his battered craft and was up in arms at
once.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a test of the canoes,” he said indignantly.
“This one is twice as fast as yours.
If Punk hadn’t nearly lost his paddle we’d have
shown you. Besides, I was tired. You fellows
had been resting up there.”</p>

<p>Poke lifted his head, gave a gasp for breath,
and said:</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have beat us if you’d just got
out of bed, Bull.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I? I’ll row you again any time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
you like; if I can find some one to take the bow,”
he added with a disgusted glare at Gibbs.</p>

<p>Gibbs grinned and winked at Poke. “What
you want in the bow, Bull,” he said, “is a
gasoline motor!”</p>

<p>“I tell you what I’ll do with you,” offered
Poke quietly. “I’ll race you Saturday morning
up-stream from the old bridge to the landing
here. You take any canoe you like and I’ll
do the same. It isn’t the canoe, Bull, it’s
science that counts!”</p>

<p>“Science!” scoffed Bull. “Why, you
couldn’t paddle that far to save your life!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that worry you,” Poke replied
soothingly. “Will you try it?”</p>

<p>“What would be the use? You say yourself
that you’ve never paddled a canoe before.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I’m awfully quick to learn,
Bull. I’m a clever little lad that way. What
do you say, now? Try it? We’ll start at the
old bridge and I’ll beat you to the boat-house
here. If I don’t get here at least a length ahead
of you I’ll black your shoes for you on the front
steps of Mem!”</p>

<p>“I hope you lose,” said Gibbs vindictively.
“Bull’s shoes need blacking most of the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” said Gary. “I’ll race you.
And if I don’t beat you I’ll—I’ll—”</p>

<p>“Careful now! Don’t say anything you’ll
be sorry for!” laughed Poke.</p>

<p>“—I’ll black your shoes!”</p>

<p>“Done, old scout! It’s a bargain. You fellows
are witnesses.”</p>

<p>“Saturday morning, you said. What
time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, say eleven; or later, if you like,” replied
Poke.</p>

<p>“Eleven’s all right for me. And I don’t
have to use this canoe unless I want to.”</p>

<p>“Use any canoe you like and as many as
you like as long as they don’t have motors in
them. We’re to start at the old bridge and finish
here at the corner of the float. And if I
get here first you black my shoes. And if you
get here first I’m to black yours. Right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gary; and Jeffrey and Gibbs
nodded.</p>

<p>“And there’s one other thing,” said Poke.
“I want a good job done, Bull; no skimping the
heels, you know!”</p>

<p>Gary grinned. “If you don’t get your shoes
blackened until I do them, Poke, they’ll be
sights.”</p>

<p class="cap">“What made you do such a silly thing?”
asked Jeffrey of Poke as they hurried
back to Academy Hall. “You know very well
he can paddle faster than you can.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” replied Poke gravely, “the race is not
always to the swift, Jeff.”</p>

<p>“Well, a canoe race is. You’d better put in
all your spare time to-day and to-morrow practising.
You’ll have to learn to keep your canoe
straight first of all, Poke.”</p>

<p>“I shall take several lessons. I engage you
now to impart to me all the knowledge you
have, Jeff, of the gentle art of canoedling. If
I can get the hang of that twist I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>But Jeffrey shook his head. “He will beat
you to a frazzle,” he said dejectedly. “We
won to-day because our canoe was the faster of
the two. Gary is a good paddler, and he’s as
strong as an ox.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, my tearful friend! I have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
strength of a team of oxes—I mean oxen.
I’m like a horse, Jeff; I don’t know my own
strength yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll know it Saturday forenoon!
Of course you can use Mike if you want to, but
I think you’d better take one of the shorter
canoes; it would be lots easier to handle.”</p>

<p>“I mean to. I mean to take the shortest and
lightest one I can find. Can you give me a lesson
after football practice this afternoon,
Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’ll be too tired, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I never tire,” replied Poke grandly.
“I’ll meet you on the gym steps at five sharp.”</p>

<p>“It will be almost dark by that time,” Jeffrey
objected.</p>

<p>“Never mind. We’ll take a lantern, Jeff.
Maybe, though, we can start before five. You
be there at a quarter to. Or, better still, you
go down to the boat-house and get your canoe
over and ready, and I will come as soon as I
can skip off. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“That’s better. I’ll be all ready for you at
four-thirty, and you get there as soon as you
can. I’ll put you in the stern this time.”</p>

<p>“All right. I wonder how a little resin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
would go on my hands. They’re getting full of
blisters!”</p>

<p>Poke’s challenge created quite a sensation at
dinner time. Gil told him he was a chump, and
Jim, without actually saying so, confirmed the
judgment. Only Hope refused to see defeat in
prospect.</p>

<p>“Of course you can beat him!” she declared
cheerfully. “I think Brandon Gary is a perfectly
horrid boy!”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t alter the fact that he’s a
pretty good chap with the paddle,” said Gil
dryly, “or that Poke doesn’t really know one
end of a canoe from the other.”</p>

<p>“Nobody does,” replied Poke untroubledly,
passing his plate for a second helping of vegetables.
“They’re exactly alike!”</p>

<p>“Well, we will all be there to see you finish,”
laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“And we’ll all be there to see him black Bull
Gary’s shoes,” added Gil.</p>

<p>Poke viewed him sorrowfully. “It pains me
deeply, Gil, to find you have so little faith in me.
I used to think you were my friend.”</p>

<p>“You can show him all about rowing a canoe,
can’t you, Jeff?” asked Hope anxiously. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
should think if he practised hard to-morrow
he’d just beat that Gary boy all to bits!”</p>

<p>“There will be very little left of him but bits
after the race,” said Poke. “I feel sorry for
him, fellows; I actually do.”</p>

<p>The rest hooted.</p>

<p>Poke proved a diligent pupil that afternoon.
Jeffrey gave him the stern paddle and Poke
labored hard with it. And by the time darkness
drove them back to the boat-house Poke had
actually mastered the trick of holding the canoe
straight after the stroke. The next day, which
was Friday, there were two sessions on the
river, one in the morning, between Latin and
English recitations, and one again after practice
in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>“You really did very well,” said Jeffrey as
they went back to Sunnywood through the chilly
twilight. “If you can do a little bit better to-morrow
you may stand a chance of finishing
pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I shall win,” replied Poke with deep conviction.</p>

<p>By Friday noon the entire school was in possession
of the fact that Gary and Endicott were
to have a canoe race and the fellows were discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the event with much interest and amusement.
It was no secret that Poke was a veritable
tyro at the paddle, but every one who knew
Poke was certain that in some way, by luck or
pluck or sheer impudence, he would give his opponent
a hard race. To make sure, however,
that the world at large should know of the
event, Poke himself printed out and posted on
the notice board in Academy Hall a highly alluring
announcement, which read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noic">EXTRAORDINARY SPORTING EVENT!</p>

<p class="noic">EXCITING CANOE CONTEST BETWEEN TWO<br />
INTREPID MEMBERS OF THIS<br />
SCHOOL!</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock on Saturday morning Mr. Brandon
Gary and Mr. Perry Endicott will participate in
a Canoe Race to decide the Championship of Crofton
Academy. The start will be made at the Old Bridge
near Saunder’s Farm and the contest will finish at
the Boat-House float. According to the terms of the
Contest, the Loser is to black the shoes of the Winner
on the steps of Memorial Hall immediately after the
conclusion of the Race, the Loser to provide his own
Blacking and Brushes and not to skimp the Heels.
For further particulars, arrangement of Special
Trains, excursion rates, etc., see Daily Papers!</p>

<p class="noic">COME ONE!      COME ALL!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Gary didn’t altogether approve of that notice.
It sounded as though Poke meant to make a
spectacle of him, although he couldn’t just see
how that was to be accomplished. “The silly
chump can’t paddle a canoe to save his neck,”
he confided to a friend. “So what does he
mean by all this nonsense?”</p>

<p>“They say he’s been practising three or four
times a day,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“He will need more practice than that if he
is going to beat me,” grunted Gary. “I’ve a
good mind to tear that notice down.”</p>

<p>But he didn’t, and the notice continued to
provide mirth for the passers. On Friday
afternoon a complication arose and threatened
to put an end then and there to the contemplated
event. Johnny Connell put his foot down.</p>

<p>“Look here, Endicott,” he said in the gymnasium
before afternoon football practice,
“don’t you know we’ve got a game with Frawley’s
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Of course I know it, Johnny. Why?”</p>

<p>“Then you cut out this canoe race business,
my boy. I’m not going to have you get tired
and go stale at this time of the season.”</p>

<p>“But, Johnny—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cut it out, I tell you! If you don’t I’ll see
Sargent and you’ll get in trouble.”</p>

<p>Poke thought hard for a moment. Then he
drew the coach aside and there ensued a whispered
conference in a corner of the locker room,
during which a smile crept into Johnny’s face,
a smile that finally became a full-fledged grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, all right, if that’s it,” he said at
last. “But mind you don’t get tired, now.”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” Poke promised. “And don’t
you say a word to any one, Johnny. If you do
you’ll spoil the whole show.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. What time’s this race to be?”</p>

<p>“Eleven sharp, from the old bridge down the
river.”</p>

<p>Johnny chuckled. “I guess I’ll have to see
it,” he said.</p>

<p>That evening Jeffrey and Jim accompanied
Gil and Poke to Plato Society. It was not a
business meeting to-night and there were quite
a few invited guests present. It was too cold
to sit out of doors and so the social room was
filled to its capacity. As usual, there was music
and the evening passed very pleasantly. Both
Jeffrey and Jim were introduced to a number
of fellows they had not met before, and each had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
a very good time. Poke’s appearance was the
signal for wild applause, and the others had a
good deal of fun with him over to-morrow’s
canoe race. Later on Gary came in, and he,
too, was hailed with cheers, although as he had
never been very popular with the other members
of the society, his advent caused less of an ovation.</p>

<p>Gary had accepted his punishment with smiling
indifference, and at first the school at large
had been inclined to sympathize with him. But
his attitude had soon changed that. No longer
on the football team, and with no prospect of rejoining
it this fall, he pretended a vast contempt
for it and frequently predicted defeat in the
Hawthorne game. For some unknown reason
his resentment appeared to be against Duncan
Sargent and Johnny Connell instead of Mr.
Hanks or the Principal, and he was forever
criticizing the former’s efforts at leadership and
coaching. If he felt any anger against Mr.
Hanks—and I am inclined to believe that
he did not—he never betrayed it. Having
learned his lesson, Gary was quick to profit by
it, and no member of his classes was any more
docile and well-behaved than he.</p>

<p>The Platonians tried to get Poke and Gary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
together that evening and have them talk on the
subject of the race, but each fought shy of the
other, although each seemed willing enough to
talk about it when the other was out of hearing.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t the ghost of a show,” declared
Gary. “I don’t know what his game is. I
guess he just wants to make a sensation. Why,
he never paddled a canoe in his life until the
other day!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that,” said some one.
“Who says so, Bull?”</p>

<p>“He told me so himself,” replied Gary.
And it was a tribute to Poke’s veracity that no
one suggested a doubt after that. Poke when
baited waved a hand airily and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Bull,” he said with regret in
his voice. “I suppose I shouldn’t have led him
into it. But, after all, it’s just a little fun. He
will get over his disappointment in time.”</p>

<p>His audience chuckled and winked.</p>

<p>“But they say, Poke,” said one of his hearers,
“that you don’t know how to paddle.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know how to paddle! Me? Well, if
you want to believe everything you hear, that’s
not my fault. Without desiring to appear conceited,
fellows, I think I may lay claim to being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the nicest little paddler in this state, if not in the
country. I can paddle with my eyes shut and
one hand tied securely behind my back. I am
the only successful exponent of the Bob Cook
stroke.”</p>

<p>“That’s a rowing stroke, you crazy chump!”</p>

<p>“What of it? I have adapted it to canoeing,”
replied Poke calmly. “It is the stroke
with which I shall win to-morrow’s classic
event, gentlemen. I trust that you will all be
on hand to see how it is done.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be on hand to see how <em>you</em> are done,”
a fellow laughed. “Honestly, Poke, you’ve
got more cheek than any fellow in the country!”</p>

<p>“I?” said Poke with a demure smile. “You
surprise me. It shows how you misjudge my
character, Tom. I am a modest little violet, did
you but know it.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t but know it, Poke,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“The kind of a violet he means,” said another,
“is about the size of a soup plate, is yellow
and grows in the sun.”</p>

<p>“Get out,” said Poke, “that’s a forget-me-not!
You’d better go back to the Junior Class
and study your botany again.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll all be on hand to-morrow morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Poke, to root for you. And, say, Poke, if
you lose, you know, I’ll lend you my blacking
set!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>AN EARLY MORNING PRACTICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Poke possessed the ability to awake in the
morning at approximately whatever hour
he had decided upon the night before, a most
convenient gift that saved the price of an alarm
clock. On Saturday Poke made use of this
ability and was out of bed long before any one
else in the house was stirring and out of the
house without having awakened even Gil. It
was fortunate that he had put a sweater on
under his jacket, for the morning was cloudy
and chill as he set off along the road toward the
school and the river. But early as he was, Sammy
was ahead of him at the boat-house. The
latter was just unlocking when Poke arrived,
and he displayed an unflattering surprise at his
appearance.</p>

<p>“Likely you been up all night,” he said,
struggling with a yawn as he ushered Poke into
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Had your breakfast, Sammy?” Poke
asked.</p>

<p>“O’ course I have,” replied the boatman indignantly.
“Most time for dinner it is now.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had,” sighed Poke. “What’s the
smallest and lightest canoe you’ve got,
Sammy?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. There’s all kinds here. Take
your pick o’ ’em.”</p>

<p>“No, you show me, Sammy. I don’t know
much about the things.”</p>

<p>Sammy walked along the racks, chin in hand,
mumbling. Finally,</p>

<p>“Here be it,” he announced, placing his hand
on a green canvas canoe. “Light and short,
sir, and paddles itself.”</p>

<p>“All right. Put her over, Sammy.”</p>

<p>“Be you goin’ out now?” asked the boatman
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course. A little exercise before breakfast,
you know. I’m troubled with dyspepsia.
Doctor’s orders, Sammy.”</p>

<p>“You be over young to have dyspepsy,” said
Sammy, shaking his head disapprovingly.
“Too many sweets, likely. What kind o’ paddle,
now; double or single?”</p>

<p>“Single, please. That’s the ticket. See you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
later, Sammy.” And Poke dipped his blade
and leisurely headed down-stream. If his purpose
was to practise for the race he gave but
small indication of the fact, for he only put
his paddle in the water when the slow current
threatened to send him toward the banks.
Presently he had passed under the bridge at
Birch Island and was out of sight. Sammy,
who had watched from the float, turned and
ambled back to the work-shop, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“It’s puttin’ a lot o’ rich victuals in their
stummicks as does it,” he muttered as he set
about lighting the stove. “Dyspepsy be the
curse o’ the age. That,” he added as he felt
a twinge in his knee, “that an rhumatics.”
He dropped some fresh sheet-glue in the glue
pot, set it over the fire and glanced out the window.
“’Twill be soon clearin’,” he murmured.
“Likely I’d best finish paintin’ that
canoe so ’twill dry.”</p>

<p>It was about half an hour later that he heard
a noise at the float and saw Poke lifting his
canoe out of the water. Poke had acquired
very red cheeks and a hearty appetite, but
whether he had acquired more skill at paddling
remained to be seen.</p>

<p>“You be soon back,” observed Sammy, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
his head out the shop door. “Likely you
be thinkin’ some o’ breakfast by now.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of nothing else, Sammy,”
replied Poke heartily. “And, Sammy, I want
you to do me a favor.”</p>

<p>The boatman immediately looked dubious.
He didn’t believe overmuch in doing favors.
But Poke’s next action cleared his face. Poke
put his hand in his trousers pocket and brought
out a bright quarter.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a race with a fellow at
eleven o’clock,” he went on, “and I want this
same canoe. See that I get it, will you? And
here’s something for your trouble.”</p>

<p>“That be easy,” replied Sammy, “and I’ll
not be taken siller for’t.” But he did nevertheless,
slipping the quarter into the pocket of
his overalls even as he spoke. “Leave it to
me, sir, an’ ’twill be here when you come.” He
lifted the green canvas canoe and placed it
athwart a couple of horses in the shop.
“Likely,” he added, “it be in need o’ repairin’.”</p>

<p>Poke just barely got into chapel in time.
Afterwards Gil and Jim and Jeffrey were curious
to know where he had been.</p>

<p>“I’ve been on the river,” replied Poke. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
thought it would be a good idea to have a sort
of dress rehearsal, you see.”</p>

<p>Gil viewed him suspiciously. Finally, “Look
here, Poke,” he said, “is this on the level, this
race?”</p>

<p>“No, on the river,” replied Poke flippantly,
“and you know they’re never quite level.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” asked Jeffrey, “that you
went down at six o’clock and paddled over the
course?”</p>

<p>“Something like that. But it was before
six, I think. Say, you chaps, for the love
of Mike, walk up, will you? I’m just about
starved to death! I came mighty near nibbling
the varnish off the settee in chapel. This before-breakfast
exercise is great stuff, I tell you.
You ought to try it, Jeff. You never eat anything
to speak of. Get into your little canoe
some morning and paddle a couple of miles and
just see how it tones you up. It’s marvelous!
Anybody got any chocolate about their person?
Or a slab of chewing gum? Or any other little
thing that will keep life in my starving body?”</p>

<p>But nobody had. Jim offered a cough-drop
from the corner of his waistcoat pocket, but
after looking it over Poke refused it indignantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
“I can get all the dirt I want without
having to take paregoric with it,” he said.</p>

<p>Gil had gotten it into his head that there was
something “fishy,” as he put it, about the race,
and tried his best to get Poke to confess to some
scheme of villainy. But Poke only looked hurt
and injured and said he was sorry that a fellow
he had always liked and respected should
entertain such doubts as to his integrity. However,
as he said most of it with his mouth filled
with breakfast, the full effect was lost.</p>

<p>But I am certain that the reader is quite as
interested in the race and as anxious to witness
it as was the school in general; although
I trust he does not share Gil’s miserable suspicions;
and so I will hurry on to the appointed
moment. Long before eleven o’clock practically
every canoe, skiff and tub in commission
was on the water and the boat-house was
emptier than it had ever been since spring.
Sammy was dazed and indignant. Some few
fellows who did not trust themselves to manage
an oar or paddle elected to see the contest
from the bank, and the more energetic of these
got away early and walked down to the starting-point.
Most, however, were satisfied to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
finish of the race from the stone bridge over
Birch Island or from the float itself.</p>

<p>Now for a thorough understanding of this
terrific contest it is incumbent on the reader to
know a little about the course of the river.
What Poke called the old bridge was a wooden
structure which crossed the river about half
a mile below the school as the crow flies and
about a mile as the river runs. For the river
turns thrice in that distance, curving once to
the north-west in a wide sweep and then again
to the south-east and finally a third time toward
the west. It describes a giant S, with the
upper loop, viewed from the school float, round
and large and the lower loop smaller and flattened.
After finishing the second loop the
river meanders south-westerly in a generally
straight direction. Imagine, then, the start of
the race to be at a point about at the middle of
the top curve of the S and the finish at a point
just beyond the final end of the letter. What,
then, would have been scarcely more than a
mile could one have walked the distance in a
straight line, was fully twice the distance by
boat. And a mile against the current is no
light feat for one whose canoeing experience has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
stretched over such a small space of time as a
week.</p>

<p>Both contestants were on hand early at the
boat-house. At twenty minutes to eleven Poke
stepped majestically into the Mi-Ka-Noo and,
in company with Gil, Jim, Jeffrey and Hope,
put off for the starting-point. Behind the Mi-Ka-Noo
bobbed the little green canoe that Poke
had chosen in the morning. The Mi-Ka-Noo
was pretty well loaded but stood the ordeal
beautifully. Poke was calm and heroic, Gil suspicious,
Jim frankly amused, Jeffrey anxious
and Hope so excited that she could scarcely sit
still. She did, however, because Jim nipped
every wriggle in the bud, so to speak. Accompanying
the Mi-Ka-Noo, for all the world as
though it was the Royal Barge of an Eastern
Potentate—the expression is Poke’s, not mine—went
a flotilla of canoes and boats filled with
laughing boys in a very holiday mood. Poke
was the recipient of much advice and the butt
of many jokes, but Poke this morning was absolutely
impressive. I have said that he was
calm, but that scarcely expresses the quiet, almost
haughty, determination of his countenance.
Hope was positively fascinated by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and deliberately seated herself with her face toward
the stern, so that she could feast her eyes
on the noble hero.</p>

<p>Brandon Gary had preceded them down the
river, paddling in the blue canoe he had selected
for the race. This, explained Poke, was a mistake.
It was unwise to exert one’s self before
the contest. He believed in saving his strength.
Gil, who was doing his best at the bow, to keep
the Mi-Ka-Noo from colliding with the other
boats, grunted ironically. The starting-place
looked like the English Thames on a regatta
day. The sun had come out gloriously and the
variously colored canoes and cedar boats glistened
in the sunlight. Joe Cosgrove, the baseball
captain, had been chosen official, combining
the duties of referee, judge, timer and
starter. Joe had provided himself with a small
pistol and was determined to do his part in
ship-shape fashion. He was also determined to
waste no time, having an engagement to play
golf at a quarter past eleven with Mr. Arroway,
the English instructor. So he watched impatiently
while Poke stepped carefully into his
green canoe—Poke still held canoes in deep
respect and boarded them circumspectly—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
all the impressiveness possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Paddle over here, Poke, and get in place,”
he called.</p>

<p>Poke, without replying, took up his paddle
and looked it all over, much as a batsman examines
a favorite bat or a billiard player his
cue, much to the amusement of the spectators.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” called Gil. “It isn’t
loaded, old man.”</p>

<p>Poke thereupon carefully placed the tip of
the paddle in the water, moved it experimentally,
withdrew it and once more scrutinized it
carefully. Cosgrove sputtered.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, Poke, get a move on,
can’t you?”</p>

<p>Poke appeared to have heard him for the first
time and glanced across inquiringly. “Are
you waiting for me?” he asked surprisedly.</p>

<p>“Get in line with Gary there,” directed Joe.
“Get those bows even. Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Poke agreed that he was, and so did Gary.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em></p>

<p>That was Joe’s pistol. Gary dug his paddle
and the blue canoe darted ahead. Poke dug his
paddle and the green canoe followed, but more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
slowly. Poke, agreed the crowd, was going to
let Gary set the pace. You couldn’t fool old
Poke! You’d have to get up pretty early in
the morning to get ahead of him! The flotilla
followed, cheering and laughing and shouting
advice to the contestants.</p>

<p>“Go it, Bull! You’re doing fine!”</p>

<p>“Keep after him, Poke! Wear him out!
That’s the stuff!”</p>

<p>“’Rah for Endicott!”</p>

<p>“’Rah for Gary!”</p>

<p>The great race had begun!</p>

<small>THE GREAT RACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">For a time it seemed that the race would
come to an ignominious end then and there,
for the other canoes, or such of them as were
paddled by two or more fellows, followed so
closely that at the end of the first hundred yards
they were on both sides of the contestants and
even in front of them!</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, can’t you?” bawled
Gary. “Give me room!”</p>

<p>Poke, a length and more behind, was not
bothered by the convoy, and chuckled at Gary’s
dilemma. But Joe Cosgrove came to the rescue.
Joe was sculling in a tub.</p>

<p>“Keep back there!” he shouted. “Keep
back of the race or I’ll call it off!”</p>

<p>“If they don’t get back I’ll claim a foul!”
shouted Gary, encouraged by the referee’s support.</p>

<p>“So will I!” announced Poke. “I’ll claim
two fouls!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>But the referee’s command had the desired
effect and Gary’s blue canoe swept out of the
press, followed by its green competitor. Joe
followed close behind Poke and the rest of the
craft came bobbing along back of Joe in merry,
laughing confusion. The Mi-Ka-Noo had been
lucky enough to secure a position well in the
lead of the followers from where during the
first stage of the race both canoes were in plain
sight.</p>

<p>“Poke’s just simply going to pieces,”
mourned Jeffrey. “Look at him! He can’t
keep her nose straight at all!”</p>

<p>“He can’t paddle, and he knows it,” answered
Gil. “What I’m wondering is what’s
his idea? I’ll bet anything he never thought
of winning this race by paddling.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s got a motor hidden in his canoe,”
suggested Jim with a laugh.</p>

<p>“If he has he’d better start it going,” said
Jeffrey. “He had to stop paddling then and
straighten his canoe out. Why doesn’t he remember
what I told him?”</p>

<p>“Is he much behind?” asked Hope anxiously,
craning forward.</p>

<p>“About three or four lengths,” answered
Jim. “Sit still or you’ll have us overboard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s just doing that to fool him,” said
Hope. “You wait!”</p>

<p>But if Poke was playing fox he was overdoing
it, for now Gary was increasing his lead
with every stroke of his paddle. The blue
canoe was going finely, Gary’s bare arms working
the paddle with the power and regularity of
a piece of machinery. He was at the end of
the first loop of the course now and the starting-point
was already hidden from sight by the
trees which grew to the water’s edge on both
sides. The sound of the accompanying boats
grew less and less, showing that Poke, keeping
them back, was rapidly losing. But it was not
until the stream turned to the right again on
the beginning of the second loop that Gary allowed
himself to turn and look behind him.
When he did so he smiled. Not a canoe was
in sight on so much of the winding stream as
lay within his vision. In another moment, easing
a little from the pace he had been setting,
he was around the point, keeping as close to the
bank as the channel would allow. He was beginning
to be aware of aching muscles in arms
and legs and back, and so he shifted his paddle
to the right for a few minutes. The river still
turned so that he could see only a hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
or so ahead of him at a time, but presently the
bridge at Birch Island crept into sight down
the stream; first the tip end of it on the Crofton
side of the river, then the second stone pier
and the edge of the island and then the whole
bridge. There were spectators on it. They
were waving to a youth on the bank who was in
the act of dropping a green canoe into the
water. The green canoe, which had a strange
likeness to the one which Poke Endicott was in,
disappeared under the further arch of the
bridge and went out of sight. The fellows on
the bridge disappeared, too, running to the
other side to watch it. But by the time Gary
neared the bridge they were back again, shouting
to him and cheering loudly. Gary experienced
a glow of pleasure at the discovery of
such a warm sentiment in his favor. As he
neared the faces leaning over the parapet he
was puzzled, however, to account for the expressions
on them, and for the burst of laughter
that greeted him. There was something ironic
in that laughter, and he realized dimly that the
shouts of encouragement were not altogether
sincere.</p>

<p>“Go it, Gary! Eat ’em up! Paddle hard!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dig, Bull! You’ll get him yet! That’s the
boy!”</p>

<p>The shouting died away as he swept his canoe
out from under the old stone arch and left the
bridge and the island behind. Ahead was
the boat-house and the float and the end of the
race—and victory! And ahead, too, was a
green canoe, a green canoe with a boy in the
stern whose back looked marvelously like Poke
Endicott’s! Of course it couldn’t be Poke,
for Poke was yards and yards behind. Gary
turned and looked. Just beyond the bridge
came the pursuit. He could see the boats under
the arches. Which was Poke’s he couldn’t
tell, but Poke was there somewhere, vanquished
and discomfited. Of course, only—<em>who</em> was
the boy ahead? And why were the watchers
on the float waving to him and shouting? Now
he had stopped paddling and they were helping
him out and slapping him on the back and cheering.
Of course it wasn’t Poke; that was impossible;
but it looked—</p>

<p><em>It was Poke!</em></p>

<p>The fellow had turned and Gary had seen his
face. For a moment Gary stopped paddling
and stared open-mouthed as though at an apparition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
What did it mean? Poke had not
passed him on the way up. Or—was it possible
that he had passed and that he hadn’t seen
him? That was an awful thought, for it suggested
that he was losing his senses! Nonsense!
It was some trick, some—</p>

<p>Then Gary saw it all! Poke had carried
across the point!</p>

<p>Gary realized that the current was carrying
him down-stream and dug his paddle again.
After all, it was all right, for plenty of fellows
could testify to having seen Poke put his canoe
back into the river at Birch Island. Why, Gary
had seen that himself! And others must have
seen him leave the water on the other side.
Poke had fooled him, and he supposed a lot of
the fellows would think it a good joke and try
to jolly him about it, but he had won the race
fairly and squarely, and he could afford to let
them laugh. He went on to the float leisurely.
The other canoes were almost up to him now.
The crowd at the landing watched him approach
and cheered him a little for consolation. At the
edge of the float stood Poke, bearing his honors
as modestly as might be. He leaned down and
held Gary’s canoe for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well paddled, Bull,” he said heartily.
“But what was the trouble? Did you strike a
snag or run aground?”</p>

<p>“You think you’re smart, don’t you?” replied
Gary indignantly. “Gee, you couldn’t
do a thing, Poke, without trying to make a silly
farce of it! You make me tired!”</p>

<p>“Farce!” repeated Poke in amazement.
“Oh, now, I say, Bull, don’t be grouchy because
I beat you. Shake hands and let’s forget it.
It isn’t my fault if I can paddle faster than you
can, is it now?”</p>

<p>“Paddle!” fumed Gary, climbing onto the
float. “Run, you mean! You cheated!”</p>

<p>Poke shook his head and viewed sorrowfully
the fellows who had huddled around at the first
sounds of the altercation. “I thought you
were a good loser, Bull,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“Loser! I am when I lose. But I haven’t
lost. You carried across the point to Birch
Island. Why, dozens of fellows saw you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out, Bull,” said one of the audience.
“Don’t get sore about it. He beat you
fair and square—”</p>

<p>“Of course I did,” agreed Poke soothingly.</p>

<p>Gary sputtered with indignation. “Fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
and square! Why—why, he took his canoe
out of the water and ran across the point with
it, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“What! Oh, get out, Gary!”</p>

<p>“You’re sore, Bull!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t, did you, Poke?”</p>

<p>“Sure I did. It was quicker that way. I
wonder you didn’t think of it, Bull.”</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” demanded Gary in
triumph as the other canoes and boats began
to unload their passengers. “He knew he
couldn’t win fairly and so—”</p>

<p>“Now you hold on a minute, Bull,” commanded
Poke smilingly. He pushed his way
toward the other end of the float. “Jeff, where
are you? Who’s seen Punk Gibbs?” Punk
answered from nearby and Jeffrey hobbled
through the crowd. “Now, then,” resumed
Poke. “Bull says I didn’t win the race fairly.
What do you fellows say? You were there
when we made the agreement.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey hesitated. “Well,” he said, “you
know you carried your canoe across the land,
Poke.”</p>

<p>“Of course. What of it? What were the
terms of the challenge?”</p>

<p>“You were to start together at the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
bridge,” spoke up Gibbs, “and the one who got
here first was to have his shoes blacked by the
other fellow. That’s the agreement, because I
took notice that you didn’t say anything about
canoes.”</p>

<p>“Is that the way you remember it, Jeff?”
asked Poke.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is. But it hadn’t occurred to
me—”</p>

<p>“It was understood that we were to race in
canoes,” exclaimed Gary hotly. “If you’d
meant a running race—”</p>

<p>“You may have understood it that way,”
said Poke, “but I certainly didn’t.” He looked
at his shoes. “Got your blacking handy,
Bull?”</p>

<p>“No, and don’t you think for a minute that
I’m going to black your shoes for you! You
didn’t race fair, and every one knows it! I won
that race—”</p>

<p>But the sentiment of the crowd was against
Gary. It was too good a joke to be spoiled by
quibbles.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Bull!”</p>

<p>“Of course he beat you! He didn’t say anything
about staying in the canoes!”</p>

<p>“Go on and get your blacking, Bull!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Every one over to Mem!”</p>

<p>And the crowd, jostling and laughing, swept
Gary and Poke with it up the bank, Gary asking
excitedly where Joe Cosgrove was.</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear what the referee says!”
he demanded. “He hasn’t given his decision
yet! Where is he? Any one seen him?”</p>

<p>But Joe was half-way to the links by that
time, and when, hours later, Gary ran him down,
he was suffering from a strange lapse of
memory.</p>

<p>“Race? Oh, I’ve forgotten all about the
race, Bull. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t I win?” demanded Gary.
“Poke carried his canoe half the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very serious accusation to make,”
said Joe gravely. “Can you substantiate it,
Bull?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can! Dozens of fellows saw
him do it! Why, you must have seen him yourself!”</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t think I could swear that Poke
carried his canoe. I did see him haul it up on
the bank once, but there’s no rule to keep a
chap from taking a rest if he wants to. All I
know is that he arrived at the boat-house first,
and that gives him the race, Bull.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he cheated, I tell you! Don’t you understand
that?”</p>

<p>“I tell you what you do, Bull,” said Joe
finally. “You bring some good, reliable witnesses
to me to prove that Poke carried his
canoe instead of paddled it and I’ll—I’ll hear
’em.”</p>

<p>But Gary had cooled down by the next day
and the witnesses never testified. I don’t think
Gary ever saw the humor of that memorable
aquatic contest, but he got so after awhile that
he could grin when he was teased about it, and
that wasn’t so bad for Gary. But he never
blackened Poke’s shoes. And I, for one, don’t
blame him!</p>

<p>The school enjoyed the event for days afterward
and some of the Juniors got together and
presented Poke with a loving-cup—which had
all the ear-marks of a tin gallon measure—suitably
inscribed in black paint. In the inscription
Poke was referred to as the “Champion
Dry-Ground Canoist of the World.”</p>

<p>“But do you mean to tell me,” asked Jeffrey
after the race that forenoon, “that you went
down this morning at half-past six or some such
unearthly time and carried that canoe through
the woods for practice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Poke. “You see, I
wasn’t certain it could be done, on account of
the bushes and things.”</p>

<p>“Nice time to find out about it,” laughed
Jim. “Suppose you had found that it couldn’t
be done?”</p>

<p>“Then I’d had to follow my original plan,
which was to use two canoes.”</p>

<p>“Two canoes? How could you have done
that?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d have started in one, left it on the
bank, hot-footed it through the woods and
picked up another which would have been waiting
for me. But I didn’t quite like to do that.
It didn’t seem quite fair, you see. Of course
there was nothing in the agreement prohibiting
the use of two canoes, or twenty, but—well,
there’s the spirit of the law to consider as well
as the letter.” And Poke looked as virtuous as
a saint.</p>

<p>“You’re a silly chump,” observed Gil with
conviction. “Why did you let Jeff here wear
himself out trying to teach you to handle a paddle
if you didn’t mean to use it?”</p>

<p>Poke grinned. “Because Jeff was troubled
about me and I knew he’d feel a lot better if he
thought he was teaching me how to win the race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
I didn’t want to cause him any uneasiness,
Gil.”</p>

<p>“You and your uneasiness!” scoffed Gil.
“If I were Jeff I’d punch your head for you!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do worse than that some day,” laughed
Jeffrey. “I’ll take him out in a canoe and
leave him there helpless!”</p>

<p>Poke laughed. “It was funny, though, fellows,”
he said, “to see the look on Bull’s face
when he saw me on the float. He was so flabbergasted
that he sat with his paddle in the air
and let the canoe drift down-stream with him!
I’ll bet that for a minute he thought it was my
ghost he saw!”</p>

<p>Hope, I think, was a little disappointed in the
outcome of the race. She had wanted Poke to
prove a hero and instead of that he had only
proved a practical joker. And Hope, while her
sense of humor was extremely well developed,
failed to appreciate the joke as much as the boys
did. She confided to Poke some days later that
she wished he would learn to paddle perfectly
jimmy and then beat “that Gary boy” in a real
race. And Poke gravely consented to think the
matter over.</p>

<p>For awhile speculation was rife as to the duration
of Gary’s term of probation, but after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Cosgrove had settled into the position of right
guard and it was observed that that side of the
line appeared as strong as ever the school became
less concerned with Gary’s fortunes.
Cosgrove, although he had never played the
position before, soon became a proficient right
guard, and Curtis, accustomed to the other side
of the line, took very kindly to his change.
Crofton met and defeated three adversaries and
then ran into a snag in the shape of Chester
Polytechnic. “Poly” swept the Academy team
off its feet and won the game in a romp. But
“Poly” had a way of doing that, and Crofton
was not disheartened. The game proved that
the weakest place in the line was at left tackle,
where Marshall, willing and hard-working,
hadn’t the stamina for the position. And yet
Marshall was the best material in sight and
Johnny decided to keep him, trusting that in the
Hawthorne game Sargent, on one side, and Gil
Benton, on the other, would help him out.
After the Polytechnic game came a battle with
Cupples Academy, and Crofton crawled out
victor by a single goal from field. With two
contests remaining before the Hawthorne game
the season settled into the home-stretch. Graduates
ran out to Crofton for a day or two at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a time and looked the team over and gave advice
and sometimes took a hand in the coaching,
and ran back to college or business quite satisfied
with their devotion to alma mater. But the
man behind the team was Johnny, and Johnny
pursued the even tenor of his way, undisturbed.
Rumors of exceptional ability on the part of the
Hawthorne eleven might cause uneasiness to
others, but Johnny paid them no heed. He had
heard that sort of thing many, many times
before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jim was getting on with rapid
strides, and there came a day when the name
of Hazard was on every tongue. For on that
day Jim broke through Curtis, blocked a kick,
captured the ball and sped forty yards for a
touchdown. As the first team’s best that afternoon
was a field goal, Jim’s feat brought a victory
to the second, and he went off the field a
hero in the eyes of ten panting, happy players.
But brilliant tricks of that sort are not the common
lot of tackles and Jim’s best work was of
the sort that doesn’t show much. By now he
had learned how to handle Cosgrove, while
Curtis and he battled day after day with honors
fairly even. But while Jim was making fine
progress on the gridiron he was scarcely holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
his own in class. A boy must be peculiarly
constituted to work heart and soul for the success
of his team and yet not show a falling off
at recitations. And Jim, since it was his first
attempt at serving two masters, was beginning
to find himself at outs with his instructors.
Oddly enough it was with Latin that he had the
most trouble those days and it was Mr. Hanks
who first scared him.</p>

<p>“It won’t do, Hazard,” said the instructor
one day. “You’ll have to give more time to
your Latin. Don’t let me find you unprepared
again this month, please.”</p>

<p>That night Jim settled down in the quiet and
seclusion of his own room and dug hard. And
the next day, and the next after that, Mr. Hanks
viewed him kindly. But in specializing on
Latin Jim had neglected his other studies and
he heard from that. Two weeks before the final
game Jim was looking worried and had become
so irritable that Hope declared she was certain
he was about to be ill. And unfortunately his
troubled condition of mind reflected itself in his
playing and on the second team it was whispered
around that Jim was getting “fine.”
And then came the game with Fosterville
School, one crisp Saturday afternoon in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of November. And when it was over, with the
score 12 to 5 in favor of the enemy, the future
looked pretty dark for Crofton. For Marshall
had been dragged out of a play limp and white,
his usefulness to the team a thing of the past.
The doctor declared it only a severe wrench of
the left shoulder but Marshall took it badly and
Johnny knew that even if Marshall pulled
around in a week the accident had taken every
bit of fight out of him. And so it was that the
second lost another lineman to the first team,
for by the middle of the following week, after
trying out Parker and Hazard for the position,
the much coveted, but unhoped for, honor fell
to Jim.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE SWORD FALLS!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Jim broke into the first team on Wednesday.</p>

<p>That night there was a celebration at
Sunnywood. Jeffrey began it with two bottles
of ginger ale which he produced after study
hour. They drank Jim’s health in that enticing
beverage and then Poke suggested that some
cake wouldn’t be half bad. So Hope was summoned
and Mrs. Hazard was appealed to and
the party adjourned to the dining-room where a
spread worthy of the occasion was speedily
forthcoming. Every one was very merry save
Jim. Jim was wondering when the sword
would fall, for he had flunked badly that morning
in mathematics and had barely scraped
through in Latin. And that was why he protested
when Poke had the merry thought of inviting
Mr. Hanks to the feast.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Jim, “let him alone, Poke.”</p>

<p>“I think he ought to participate in our merry-making,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Poke persisted. “You run up and
invite him down, Hope.”</p>

<p>“Shall I?” asked Hope, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jim. But the others insisted and
Hope hurried away on her errand.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, he won’t come,” predicted
Jim. But he did. He didn’t quite know what
it was all about, but he and Hope were very
good friends by now and he came unquestioningly,
smiling and blinking behind his huge
spectacles. It was explained to him that Jim
had that day attained to the utmost pinnacle of
success by being taken onto the Crofton Academy
Football Team, and Mr. Hanks murmured
“Dear, dear! I want to know!” nibbled at a
piece of cake and wondered how soon he could
in decency return to his interrupted labors upstairs.
Finally he did go back, shaking hands
with Jim in an absent-minded way first, with
one of Mrs. Hazard’s serviettes dangling from
his coat pocket. The party proceeded quite as
merrily without him, however. Poke rallied
Jim on his quietness.</p>

<p>“I fear the sudden honor is too much for you,
Jim. You used to be rather a merry youth.
To-night you remind me of a graveyard gate
post. Why so sad?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m tired,” murmured Jim.</p>

<p>“Then, Jim dear,” said Mrs. Hazard, “I
really think you had better not eat any more
cake. I’m sure that must be your fifth slice.
And you ate a great big supper.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’ve been counting
the slices!” ejaculated Poke. “Why,
that’s not like you, Lady.”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t count all you’ve eaten,” declared
Hope. “You’re a—a gridjon!”</p>

<p>“A what-on?” asked Poke anxiously.</p>

<p>“A gridjon. A gridjon is a person who eats
too much.”</p>

<p>“Webster or Hazard?” laughed Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“It’s a perfectly good word of my own,” replied
Hope with dignity.</p>

<p>But although Jim tumbled into bed in short
time he didn’t go right to sleep. Instead he lay
awake for quite a while wondering how long, if
he didn’t make a much better showing in class,
faculty would allow him to enjoy his new honors.
And when sleep did come to him finally it was
because he had comforted his conscience with
the firm resolve to buckle down to-morrow and
study as never before.</p>

<p>But, alas, how many of our good resolutions
survive the night? The next day was filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
new experiences for Jim, and much hard, gruelling
work on the field, and a blackboard lecture
in dining hall after dinner. And so, when study
time came, he was tired and nervous and his
thoughts absolutely refused to concern themselves
with studies. And the following day Mr.
Groff, the mathematics instructor, lectured him
in front of the whole class, which didn’t improve
Jim’s state of mind a bit, and Mr. Hanks viewed
him sadly but forebore to reprimand him. In
his other studies he was doing fairly well as yet.</p>

<p>There was no practice on Friday and Jim
locked himself up in his room, in spite of the
fact that Johnny had instructed them to stay
out of doors and take mild exercise, and heroically
studied. But the faculty of assimilation
seemed to have deserted him of late and it was
the hardest sort of work to make anything stick
in his memory for more than a minute. But he
kept at it until supper time and then emerged
tired and fagged.</p>

<p>In the Merton contest the next day, the last
before the “big game,” Crofton showed flashes
of first-rate football. Although he didn’t say
so, Johnny was well satisfied, for he knew that,
barring accidents, his team would play at least
twenty per cent. better a week from that day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Crofton was still coming, and a team that is
coming is better than one that has reached the
zenith of its development. Merton went down
in defeat, 17 to 8, after a hard-fought battle.
Best of all, Crofton emerged from the fray with
scarcely a scratch, at all events with no real
injuries to any of her players. Jim played well
in that game. For four twelve-minute periods
he forgot all about Latin and mathematics and
thought and lived football. And Johnny, who
hadn’t liked the haggard look in Jim’s eyes, concluded
that his fears were groundless, and confided
to Captain Sargent after the game that
“That fellow Hazard is the best find of the
season.”</p>

<p>And then, on Monday, the sword fell!</p>

<p>He was summoned to the office at noon.
What Mr. Gordon said and what excuses Jim
offered are of small consequences. We are interested
in results. The result in this case was
that Jim emerged from Academy Hall feeling
that life was indeed a very tragic thing. That
afternoon Parker played at left guard on the
eleven and all the school knew that Hazard was
“in wrong with the Office.”</p>

<p>Johnny was a philosopher. Such things had
happened to him before. He wasted no breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
in regrets nor recriminations. He picked the
next best man for Jim’s place and went ahead.
Perhaps he was a little grimmer in the face that
afternoon and a little more silent, but that was
all. Duncan Sargent, his nerves already jangling
as a captain’s nerves are likely to jangle
when the last week of the season arrives, was
in despair.</p>

<p>“First it’s Gary,” he groaned, “and then
it’s Marshall and now it’s Hazard. Well, I’d
like to know what’s going to happen next! We
might as well hand the game to Hawthorne and
save the trouble of playing!”</p>

<p>Poke, to whom these remarks were addressed
just before the beginning of practice, was as
gloomy as his captain. He had known nothing
of Jim’s misfortune until a few minutes before,
for Jim had not shown up at dinner hour and
Poke had not glimpsed him since morning.</p>

<p>“Gee,” he muttered, “it’s all a surprise to
me. I never suspected that Jim wasn’t getting
on all right in class. You don’t suppose J. G.
will let him back in a day or two?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Sargent despondently.
“What if he does? A fellow can’t
drop training for two or three days on the eve
of the big game and then play decently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jim could,” said Poke thoughtfully. “I
wonder where the chump is. I suppose he isn’t
here, eh?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen him.” Sargent shrugged
his broad shoulders. “What’s more, I don’t
want to. If a fellow doesn’t think enough of
the success of his school to study a few silly
lessons we’re better without him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, be good,” Poke chided. “It was only
two years ago that you were off for a whole
week for the same reason, Dun.”</p>

<p>“And I learned my lesson,” said the other
gloomily.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Jim Hazard’s learning
his,” replied Poke. “Only I wish he’d chosen
some other time. How’s Parker going to fit?”</p>

<p>Sargent kicked viciously at a football that had
rolled up to them. “Rotten!” he said.</p>

<p>Practice went badly that day, just as it’s
likely to on the Monday after a hard game, and
there was a general air of discouragement about
coach and players alike. The second team,
grumbling over the loss of another lineman,
smashed vengefully at their opponents and tied
the score in the second half of the scrimmage.
And so it stayed and the second credited themselves
with what was virtually a victory. Gil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Poke and Jeffrey walked home together after
practice and talked over Jim’s predicament.</p>

<p>“Success,” said Gil, “was too much for
him.”</p>

<p>“That’s not fair,” remonstrated Poke.
“Jim got onto the team late and has had to
learn a whole lot in a short time. Hang it, Gil,
I haven’t been doing any too well at studies,
myself, and I’ve been playing football long
enough to know the ropes. I don’t wonder that
Jim fell behind. The question now is can he
catch up and square himself with the Office before
Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Is it all studies or one or two?” asked
Jeffrey.</p>

<p>Poke shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t
know. Why didn’t he say something to some
of us? I noticed that he seemed rather down
in the mouth, but I didn’t suspect this. I
thought he was just worried for fear he
wouldn’t make good at playing.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose started the trouble?”
asked Gil. “Who do you and Jim have, Jeff?”</p>

<p>“Hanks in Latin and history, Groff in math,
Arroway in English, Lewellyn in French and
Thurston in physics.”</p>

<p>“Well, it might be ‘Gruff,’” said Gil, “or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
it might be ‘Boots.’ (‘Boots’ was the popular
name for Mr. Thurston.) It isn’t likely
that Hanks had anything to do with it; nor
Lewellyn. As for English, why, no fellow has
trouble in that course.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure about Nancy, though,” said
Jeffrey. “Ever since we turned him into a
tyrant he’s been pretty fussy about us having
our lessons. But I think it was probably Groff
that started the trouble. He gave Jim a calling-down
in class last week.”</p>

<p>“Gruff always was a tartar,” grumbled Poke.
“I never knew a mathematics instructor who
wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, the question is,” observed Gil, “is
there anything we can do to pull Jim out of his
hole? There’s five days yet before the game.
Something might be done.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Johnny would let him play
after being laid off,” said Poke gloomily.
“Dun’s got a grouch against him, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, the first thing to do is to find him,”
said Jeffrey. “I haven’t seen him since
physics.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s feeling so mean he’s hiding
out somewhere,” Poke suggested. “I don’t
blame him for being cut up about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim, however, wasn’t very far off when the
trio entered the gate. He was sitting at the
table in his room with his books spread before
him looking disconsolately out of the window.
“No more athletics, Hazard, until your marks
are considerably better in all studies, Latin and
mathematics especially,” had been Mr. Gordon’s
ultimatum. Jim had spent the dinner
hour sitting on a spile near the bridge, gazing
into the water and wondering on the lack of
gratitude displayed by Mr. Hanks. For Mr.
Gordon had distinctly said that it had been the
Latin instructor who had made complaint. Jim
was through with the team and wouldn’t have
shown up at training table for anything. Nor
did he want to go home and face his chums at
Sunnywood just then. Besides, he was much
too disappointed and miserable to want anything
to eat. Of course, he had reflected, it was
all his own fault, but that knowledge didn’t seem
to make the situation any easier. He found a
little satisfaction in calling Mr. Hanks names.
It seemed to him that after the way they had
come to Nancy’s assistance with advice the least
he could have done was to have been a little more
lenient with Jim Hazard. He wished he had
never gone in for football; wished he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
come to Crofton. Then the bell rang and he
dragged himself back along the river to Academy
Hall and a French recitation. After that
there had been physics, and then, when most of
the fellows were setting their faces toward the
field, he had hurried home and shut himself in
his room. His mother had sought entrance and
he had put her off with the plea that he was busy
studying, but as a matter of fact there had been
very little studying done that afternoon. His
thoughts simply refused to stay on his books.
It was almost dark now in the room, and through
the window the western sky was paling from
orange to gray. He heard the gate click and
then came the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
Some one knocked imperatively at his door.</p>

<p>“Hello?” he growled.</p>

<p>“We want to come in, Jim.” It was Poke’s
voice. And the tone told Jim that Poke had
heard.</p>

<p>“I’m working,” replied Jim, more gruffly.</p>

<p>“It’s time to quit. Open up, like a good
fellow.”</p>

<p>“Too busy,” replied Jim. There was a
whispered conference beyond the door and then
footsteps died out along the hall. Jim felt more
lonely than ever then and wished he had let them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
in. But pride kept him there behind the locked
door until the supper bell rang, and then until
Hope came up to find why he wasn’t down.
Hope had to beg her hardest before she was admitted.
Then Jim said he wasn’t hungry and
wanted no supper. All he wanted was to be let
alone. So <a href="#i_p295">Hope</a> went out quietly, closing the
door after her, and, <a href="#i_p295">being a rather wise young
lady, prepared a tray</a>. After she had taken her
departure for the second time Jim sat and
looked at the tray for a long time; to be exact,
just as long as his courage lasted. Then he
gave in and ate everything in sight. After that
life didn’t look quite so dark, and when, presently,
Poke came knocking at the door again,
Jim bade him enter.</p>

<p>They talked it all over then, Gil and Jeffrey
sort of happening in, and Poke was highly incensed
at Mr. Hanks’ conduct.</p>

<p>“After what we did to help him!” he said
disgustedly.</p>

<p>“He has only followed the advice we gave
him,” observed Gil dryly. “What goes for one
goes for all, Poke.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t a grain of—of gratitude,”
spluttered Poke. “And what’s more, I’d like
to tell him so, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you talk so loud you won’t have to,” said
Jeffrey. “He will hear you now.”</p>

<p>“Let him! He’s the limit!”</p>

<p>“Stop calling names and let’s see what’s to
be done,” Gil counseled. “Think you can
catch up by Friday, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I can’t seem to get down
to studying. I’ve been trying to all the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t promise that Johnny will take
you on again even if you get square with the
Office,” said Gil, “but seems to me it’s worth
trying. You get your books and go over to
Jeff’s room. After awhile we’ll go over to-morrow’s
stuff with you. Maybe between us
we can coach you up, Jim. I’m not much of a
Latin student myself, but Poke gets on pretty
well in that; so does Jeff. As for math, why,
I’ll do what I can for you there. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>Jim thought a moment. He was still inclined
to feel hurt and imposed on. But the offer
was too good to be refused, and so,</p>

<p>“All right,” he muttered. “I’ll try it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim’s showing in class the next day was not
much better, but on Wednesday there was a
marked improvement. Every night Gil, Poke
and Jeffrey took him in hand and put him
through his paces in mathematics and Latin.
Jim was not stupid, and now that he had more
time and constant encouragement he went ahead
in good shape. If Mr. Hanks suspected the
sudden coolness exhibited toward him by Jim
and Poke he made no sign. Personally I don’t
believe that he gave it a thought. He had done
what his duty required of him in Jim’s case
and that was all. That his action had cost Jim
his position on the football team and deprived
the team of a good player he did not know. He
went his way serenely unconscious of the trouble
he had caused.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the team worked like Trojans
every afternoon, the football enthusiasm and excitement
grew to fever heat and Thursday
dawned. Thursday was the last day of practice.
The whole school marched to the field at four
o’clock, cheering and singing. Even Jim allowed
the others to persuade him to attend the
final practice, and he and the rest of the Sunnywood,
saving Mrs. Hazard, who had lost her
interest in football, now that Jim no longer
played, followed the procession, Hope wildly
enthusiastic and attracting many admiring
glances on the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing spectacular about practice
that afternoon. After the preliminary work the
rest of the time was spent in a hard signal drill
and one fifteen-minute period of scrimmaging,
the latter being halted for minutes at a time
while one or other of the coaches, who had grown
quite numerous by now, criticized and lectured,
begged and threatened. Around the field, outside
the ropes which were already in place for
Saturday’s game, all Crofton cheered and sang.
Then the final whistle sounded, the second team
gathered together and cheered the first, the
first tiredly returned the compliment and players,
coaches and onlookers trailed back to the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>Poke, a faded blanket hanging about him,
found Jim on the way out.</p>

<p>“I spoke to Sargent about you, Jim,” he
panted, “and he says if you can get square with
the Office by Saturday he’s willing to give you
a chance in the game if he can. That is, of
course, if Johnny says so. I haven’t talked with
him yet, but I will. Of course, Jim, you won’t
get in at the beginning. You see, Parker’s doing
pretty well and it wouldn’t be fair to throw
him out at the last moment, would it? Besides,
you might be a bit stale, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim nodded gloomily. “I know. Much
obliged to you, Poke, but I guess it’s no use.
I don’t even know that J. G. will give me leave
to play yet. I’m pretty square with Groff, but
Nancy doesn’t love me much, I guess. Don’t
bother about speaking to Johnny. It’s all
right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll see Johnny,” responded Poke
heartily. “You do the best you can and go
and have a talk with J. G. to-morrow. Why, supposing
you don’t get in for the whole game, Jim,
even a couple of periods is better than nothing at
all. And you’ll get your C if you only play two
minutes. Buck up and never say die, old
chap!”</p>

<p>Jim nodded again and Poke, clapping him on
the shoulder, hurried into the gymnasium. They
were cheering again now, cheering each member
of the team in turn, from Sargent down to the
latest member, Parker. There was no cheer for
Hazard, though. Jim had got parted from
Hope and Jeffrey, and presently he edged his
way out of the gathering and strode home alone
and forlorn through the twilight.</p>

<small>FRIDAY AND ILL-LUCK</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“I think,” remarked Mr. Groff, the next
morning, “that I could count on one hand
the students who have studied their algebra.
Wyman, Latham, Nutter, Hazard—if there is
another I’d like to hear from him.”</p>

<p>Thirty-odd hands went up. Mr. Groff smiled
gently and sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“If football plays may be worked out by
algebra, I believe you. We will repeat to-day’s
lesson to-morrow. I trust that as the football
season will be over on Monday we may then
return to our studies. Dismissed.”</p>

<p>Events transpired so rapidly that day that it
is difficult to tell of them in order. First of
all, though, just before noon it was known that
Curtis, formerly of the second and now playing
right tackle on the first team, had been
summoned home because of sickness in the
family. Consternation prevailed. At two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
o’clock Curtis went off, bag in hand, torn between
anxiety and disappointment. Before that
Duncan Sargent and Johnny Connell had spent
a troubled hour trying to rearrange their line
of battle. At dinner time Johnny pedaled along
the road, jumped from his wheel in front of
Sunnywood Cottage, rang the bell impatiently
and demanded Jim.</p>

<p>“Look here, Hazard,” began Johnny when
Jim reached the porch, napkin in hand, “we’ve
lost Curtis. He’s gone home. Some of his
folks ill. We’ve got to have another lineman.
There’s no one on the second heavy enough
to stand up in front of Hawthorne. Either you
or Gary must come back. I don’t care which,
but the first of you to report to me, all square
with the Office, starts the game to-morrow. I’ve
seen Gary and told him the same thing. Now
you have a talk with Mr. Gordon right away,
understand? And let me know what he says.
Come to me after school. If he lets you play
you’ll have to learn the new signals this evening.
Now hurry up and finish your dinner, and
don’t stuff yourself. Then see Mr. Gordon at
once.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Jim, his heart thumping
hard at the thought of getting back to the team.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
“I’ll see him in fifteen minutes. Where will
I find you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be in the gym at two. Before that
you’ll find me around Academy somewhere.
Get a move on. Tell Gordon you’ve <em>got</em> to
play; tell him we’ve got to have you!”</p>

<p>And Johnny hurried through the gate,
jumped on his bicycle and tore back to school.
Fifteen minutes later Jim, breathless and anxious,
ran up the steps of Academy Hall, hurried
down the corridor and entered the Office.</p>

<p>“Can I see Mr. Gordon, please?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gordon has gone to Boston,” replied
the secretary in his best official voice. “He
left at twelve o’clock.”</p>

<p>Jim’s heart sank. “When will he be back,
please, sir?” he asked. The secretary
frowned.</p>

<p>“He is not in the habit of informing me
very closely as to his plans. I believe, however,
that he expects to return sometime to-morrow
forenoon.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow forenoon!” gasped Jim.</p>

<p>“Exactly.” The trouble in the boy’s face
softened the secretary’s manner. “What was
it you wanted? Is there anything I can do for
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, thank you,” answered Jim. He
went out, closed the heavy oak door softly and
dragged his feet along the corridor. At the
corner he drew aside and Brandon Gary hurried
by him in the direction of the Office. Jim
smiled wanly. Gary and he were in the same
boat.</p>

<p>On the front steps he paused, hands thrust
deep in his pockets and tried to think what to
do. It still lacked twenty minutes of recitation
time and he had the sunlit entrance to himself.
But he could see no way out of his
quandary. Only Mr. Gordon could lift the
ban and Mr. Gordon had gone away. Jim
seated himself on the top step and stared unseeingly
at the wooded slope beyond the river.
Footsteps echoed in the corridor and Brandon
Gary came out. He saw Jim, hesitated and
then leaned against the doorway. Jim looked
up and their eyes met. Gary nodded.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Jim morosely.</p>

<p>“Say, Hazard, you and I are both up against
it, aren’t we?” said Gary. “I’d like to know
what business J. G. has going away at a time
like this.”</p>

<p>“I suppose to-morrow morning will be too
late,” responded Jim discouragedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, he won’t be back until noon. He’ll
come on the express that gets in just before
dinner. Gee, Hazard, I’d like to play to-morrow!
I’ve been thinking he might let me off
before this, but he didn’t, and I made up my
mind I wouldn’t ask. But now it’s serious.
With Curtis gone the old team’s up against it,
I guess.”</p>

<p>Jim nodded. Gary seated himself on the
other side of the steps. Silence held them for a
minute. Then Jim sighed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I guess I’ll look up
Johnny and tell him. I promised to let him
know.”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said Gary. “Look here,
Hazard, do you think it would do any good to
talk to Nancy?”</p>

<p>Jim considered a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what he could do, Gary.”</p>

<p>“He might telegraph to J. G. and ask him to
let us off.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Nancy would do that,” replied
Jim doubtfully. “Besides, we don’t
know where he is, do we?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gordon can tell us. Look here, will
you go and see him with me? Maybe we can
talk him into it. I’ll apologize to him, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
wants me to. I’ll do anything to help the team
out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go,” answered Jim, brightening a
little. “If we walk up the road maybe we’ll
meet him.”</p>

<p>They sprang up and hurried off side by side,
choosing the road instead of the wood path,
since if they took the latter they might miss the
instructor. They hadn’t far to go. As they
walked briskly around the curve behind the
Principal’s residence Mr. Hanks came into
sight a few rods away.</p>

<p>“You start it,” whispered Gary. “You
know him better. I’ll dig in afterwards.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hanks, may we speak to you a minute,
sir?” asked Jim as the instructor met them.
Mr. Hanks dropped the hand holding the book
he had been reading and brought his thoughts
back with a visible effort.</p>

<p>“Er—certainly.”</p>

<p>“Gary and I, sir, are both in wrong at the
Office, as you know. Now Curtis has gone home
and the team’s in a bad way for a fellow to
take his place in the line. We’ve been to see
Mr. Gordon and he’s gone away and may not be
back until to-morrow noon. That will be too
late, sir. Wouldn’t you be willing to say a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
good word for us, sir, to Mr. Gordon? Tell
him we—we’re sorry and—and all that, and
ask him if we can’t play to-morrow?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks looked blank. “I—I don’t
quite understand,” he said. “You want me to
intercede for you with Mr. Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Gary. “I guess I deserved
what I got, Mr. Hanks, but I’ve been on
probation for nearly a month now. I’m sorry
for what I did and I—I beg pardon, sir, I
wouldn’t have asked any favors for myself,
sir, but the team’s in a rotten mess now that
Curtis can’t play and it needs me badly, needs
both of us.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid, I don’t quite get your meaning
about this—this team. What sort of a
team is it, Gary?”</p>

<p>“Why, the football team, sir! To-morrow’s
the big game of the season, you know;
Hawthorne. And we’re going to get licked as
sure as shooting if either Hazard or I don’t get
back.”</p>

<p>“Am I to understand,” asked Mr. Hanks in
puzzled tones, “that Mr. Gordon has forbidden
you to play in the game?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course,” replied Gary a trifle impatiently.
“I haven’t played since he put me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
on probation. And Hazard here had to give up
last Monday. You can’t play if you don’t keep
up with your studies.”</p>

<p>“Really! I didn’t know that. I fear I am not
sufficiently conversant with the customs here.
I understand, then, that you want to take part
in this—this contest to-morrow. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” chorused Gary and Jim eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why—why—yes, I shall be glad to say
a good word for you both. Your work in class
has been very satisfactory since—since the
occasion we both, I am sure, regret, Gary. As
for Hazard, he seems to have taken hold earnestly
with his studies of late. But—but if
Mr. Gordon is away I don’t just see how—that
is—”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p311">“We thought you might send him a telegram,”
said Gary boldly.</a> “Tell him we’re
needed on the team and that you’re willing we
should play and ask him to give us permission.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked Mr. Hanks doubtfully,
“I should be within my—er—authority?
It—it has the appearance of interference
with the Principal’s affairs.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it would be all right. It’s been
done lots of times. You see, Mr. Hanks, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
had us punished and you have a right to ask
for pardon. And, besides, sir, it isn’t just for
us personally, it’s for the whole school! If we
don’t play we’ll be licked by Hawthorne! And
you don’t want that to happen!”</p>

<p>“Er—no, I suppose not. Naturally a victory
is much to be desired. But—but a telegram?
Wouldn’t a letter do?”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t get it in time, sir. We’ll have
to know right off; to-night or to-morrow morning
at the latest. Please say you will, Mr.
Hanks!”</p>

<p>“We-ell, yes, Gary, I’ll do as you ask. Now
what is the address?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know yet, sir. We’ll ask Mrs.
Gordon for it. If you will just write out
the telegram now, sir, I’ll get the address and
take the message down town right after
school.”</p>

<p>“Very well. If you will accompany me to
the hall I will—er—attend to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312-<br />313]</a></span></p>

<p>At a few minutes before four o’clock Gary
sent the message at the telegraph office in the
village. Mrs. Gordon had willingly supplied
her husband’s address in Boston. There was
nothing to do now but wait. Johnny was far
from satisfied with events, but told Gary and
Jim to report that evening and receive instructions
in signals. Jim was a different boy now.
At Sunnywood excitement reigned supreme.
Supper was a very perfunctory meal, for every
one was too busy listening for the footsteps of
a messenger boy to eat much. Even Mr.
Hanks, suddenly drawn into the swirl of school
affairs, displayed a mild interest in events. At
eight o’clock no reply had been received and
Hope put forward the explanation that Mr.
Gordon, who was stopping at an hotel, had gone
out to dinner with friends.</p>

<p>“He will find the telegram when he gets back
to the hotel this evening,” she declared cheerfully.
“There’s no use getting worried, Jim.
It will be all right. You see if it isn’t.”</p>

<p>Right or wrong, Jim was forced to leave the
house at twenty minutes past eight and hurry to
the locker rooms in the gymnasium, where Sargent,
Johnny and Arnold, the quarter-back,
were awaiting him and Gary. For a solid hour
and ten minutes the two boys were coached in
the new signals, and not until they were letter-perfect
were they allowed to depart. By that
time Jim’s head was in a whirl. He and Gary
walked back together through the frosty darkness,
discussing the chances of the telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
coming that night and speculating as to what
its tenor would be when it did come.</p>

<p>“Like as not,” said Jim, who was tired and
low-spirited by this time, “he will refuse to let
us off.”</p>

<p>“I have a feeling it’s going to be all right,”
answered Gary cheerfully. “Guess I’ll walk
on to your place and see if it’s come.”</p>

<p>And it had. Hope met them at the door with
the news and they went upstairs to Mr. Hanks’
room. The instructor fumbled around on his
desk and finally found the message. He
handed it to Gary. Gary read it with a broad
smile, that trailed away toward the end, and
handed it to Jim. This was the message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi hang2"><span class="smcap">Mr. Artemus Hanks</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Care Mrs. Hazard</span>, Crofton, Mass.</p>

<p>Gary’s probation lifted. Please inform him.
Hazard must pass examination in Latin before he
can take part in athletics.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Gordon.</span><br /></p>
</div>

<p>Jim reread the telegram and then laid it
back on the desk. “That lets me out,” he said
quietly. “I’m glad you’re all right, though,
Gary. If you play they won’t need me, anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Hanks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re very welcome, Jim. I—I regret
that the result in your case is so disappointing.”</p>

<p>Jim went down to the door with Gary and
bade him good night. “Glad you can play,
Gary,” he said. “And I hope we win.”</p>

<p>“We will if I can bring it about,” replied
Gary warmly. “I wish you were going in,
too, though, Hazard.” He hesitated a moment
on the steps. “Thanks for helping me.
Come and see me some time, will you?” At
the gate he turned again. “Oh, Hazard, I
say!”</p>

<p>“Yes?” replied Jim from the doorway.</p>

<p>“How about your rooms here? Haven’t got
one I could have after Christmas recess, have
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s one empty. It isn’t as good
as—as the one you saw, Gary, but it’s not bad.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come around and have a look at it some
day. Jones’s is the limit! Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” answered Jim tiredly.</p>

<p>Then he went upstairs to face the sympathy
of Gil and Poke and Jeffrey.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>HAWTHORNE COMES TO CONQUER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The day of the Hawthorne game dawned
cold and gray, with a chill breeze out of
the east that held a tang of the ocean thirty
miles away. Hawthorne came along, nearly
two hundred strong, early in the forenoon and
took possession of the village, taxing the capacities
of the railroad restaurant and the
various lunch rooms to the limit. At Sunnywood
Gil and Poke, veterans though they were,
showed unmistakable nervousness all the
morning, and it took the required efforts of
Jim and Jeffrey to amuse them. By eleven
o’clock the sun had peeped for an instant
through the gloom, promising better things for
the afternoon. The football team dined at
twelve that day, so at Sunnywood the dinner
hour was set forward correspondingly. At one
Gil and Poke, happy and cheerful now that the
time of waiting was past, set off to the field.</p>

<p>“If you don’t win, Poke Endicott,” called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Hope from the porch as the boys started down
the road, “I’ll never speak to you again!”</p>

<p>“After that threat,” laughed Poke, “I shall
simply eat ’em alive, Hope!”</p>

<p>The rest of the household, Jim, Jeffrey, Hope,
Mrs. Hazard and Mr. Hanks started an hour
later. Mr. Hanks, having had football thrust
suddenly into his philosophy, displayed an
amazing interest and curiosity. “You see,”
he confided to Mrs. Hazard, “I have never witnessed
a game of football. This may seem
strange to you, for my college was, I believe,
very successful at the game. The fact is, however,
that I never had time to attend the contests.
I am really quite curious to see how the
game is played. I think it must be—er—quite
interesting.”</p>

<p>When the Sunnywood party arrived Hawthorne,
looking in its black and orange like an
army of young Princetonians, was on the gridiron
warming up for the fray. Along the
ropes on the other side of the field Hawthorne’s
supporters were already shouting to the sky.
The sun, still coy, broke through every few
minutes and cast a pallid wash of gold over the
sere turf. It was cold enough for rugs and
heavy coats, and Hope was secretly pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that she had managed to snuggle in between her
mother and Mr. Hanks. Beyond Mrs. Hazard
sat Jim with Jeffrey beside him. By a quarter
to two the Crofton side of the field was three
and four deep along the ropes and at ten
minutes to the hour two things happened simultaneously;
the Crofton eleven, brave and colorful
in new uniforms of crimson and gray,
trotted onto the field, and the sun burst through
the murk in a sudden blaze of glory.</p>

<p>“That,” cried Hope ecstatically, “means
that we shall win!”</p>

<p>Crofton took the field for practice, Gary,
back in his togs once more, racing down the
gridiron like a colt. A moment later Gil ran up
and called to Jim across the rope.</p>

<p>“Come on and be our linesman, Jim. You
see,” he continued as Jim ducked under the
barrier and strode across the field with him,
“you’ll be nearer things and can watch the
game a heap better. There’s your partner in
crime over there with the chain. Introduce
yourself like a gentleman, shake hands and welcome
him to the funeral. They’ve got a pretty
husky set of men, haven’t they? That’s Gould,
the little chap talking to Johnny. He’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
man we’ve got to watch to-day. Gee, I wish
you were playing, Jim!”</p>

<p>“So do I. Is Gould their quarter? He
doesn’t look such a wonder, does he?”</p>

<p>“Wait till you get a good look at his face.
There’s the whistle. Wish us luck, Jim!”</p>

<p>Jeffrey moved into the seat next to Mrs.
Hazard, depositing an extra coat beside him so
that Jim might have his place if he returned.
Hawthorne spread herself over the west end
of the field to receive the kick-off, Duncan Sargent
patted the tee into shape, poised the ball
and looked around him. “All ready, Hawthorne?
All ready, Crofton?” questioned the
referee. Both teams assented, the whistle blew,
Sargent sent the ball spinning down the field
and the game was on.</p>

<p>Crofton displayed her offensive ability at the
start. Johnny had instructed the team to get
the jump on Hawthorne in the first minute of
play and carry her off her feet if possible. Arnold
obeyed directions to the letter. From the
first line-up, after the full-back had caught and
carried the ball to his thirty-five yards, Poke
Endicott tore off eighteen yards outside of
tackle and began a rushing advance that took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
the ball to Hawthorne’s fifteen-yard mark.
Hawthorne stiffened as the play neared the
goal line and Arnold tried a forward pass to
Tearney, right end. This failed and the ball
went to the Orange-and-Black. But on the very
next play Hawthorne’s left half fumbled and
Benson, Crofton’s full-back, dived into the
scramble and recovered the pigskin. Crofton’s
machine started up again and after three rushes
Poke shot through and over the goal line for a
well-earned touchdown. Sargent kicked goal.</p>

<p>The crimson-and-gray flags waved madly and
three hundred voices cheered and yelled. In
just five minutes Crofton had swept her opponent
off her feet and scored six points! That
was surely cause for rejoicing. Even Mrs.
Hazard clapped her hands, and Mr. Hanks, just
beginning to understand the scheme of things,
beamed delightedly through his spectacles. As
for Hope, why Hope was already breathless
from screaming and trembling with excitement.
Jeffrey, seeing more of the game than the
others, better appreciated the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de main</i> that
had put Crofton in the ascendancy at the very
beginning of the battle. But he wondered
whether the Crimson-and-Gray would show an
equally good defense. That was the only scoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
in the first period of fifteen minutes.
Crofton suffered a penalty for holding shortly
after the touchdown had been made, and later
was set back for off-side. However, the loss of
twenty yards had no effect on the final result,
for neither side came near scoring, and the
quarter ended with the ball in Crofton’s possession
on her rival’s twenty-seven yards.</p>

<p>Hawthorne’s chief mainstay was her quarter-back,
Gould, a remarkable all-around player.
A brainy general, a certain catcher of punts, a
brilliant runner either in a broken field or an
open and a clever manipulator of the forward
pass, Crofton held him in great respect. Hawthorne’s
team was, in a manner, built around
Gould, and in that lay whatever weakness it
possessed. Johnny had coached his players for
a fortnight to stop Gould, knowing that aside
from his performances Hawthorne had very little
to offer in the matter of ground-gaining
feats. And throughout the first period Gould
failed to get away with anything. Crofton
watched him as a cat watches a mouse and every
move of his was smothered. One twenty-yard
sprint around Tearney’s end was the best he
could do, while whenever he caught a punt in the
backfield Tearney and Gil were down on him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
stand him on his plucky little head the instant
the ball was in his arms.</p>

<p>The second period began with Crofton in
high feather. Benson and Smith, left half, each
made short gains, and then Arnold tried a forward
pass from Hawthorne’s twenty-five yard
mark. He threw too far, however, and the
Orange-and-Black received the ball on its thirteen-yard
line. Gould kicked, and, thanks to
two holding penalties, Crofton was forced back
into its own territory in the next few minutes.
Then Arnold’s punt went to Gould on his forty
yards. With the first real flash of form he had
shown, the little quarter-back tore off fifteen
yards. From the center of the field and close
to the side-line he made his first successful forward
pass, a long, low throw along the edge of
the field to his right end who caught the ball
over his shoulder and ran to Crofton’s thirty-four-yard
line. A try at the line netted two
yards. Then Gould again hurled the pigskin,
this time selecting his left end for receiver and
sending a low drive to him on Crofton’s
twenty-five-yard line. For a moment it looked
as though Hawthorne would score there and
then and the runner sprinted to Crofton’s
eight-yard line before he was pulled down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
behind. Across the field Hawthorne was wild
with joy and two hundred of her loyal sons
shouted and danced with delight. Then Hawthorne
tried one rush and lost a yard. Crofton
was now plainly over anxious and when, on the
next play, Gould sent his right half-back at the
right wing on a delayed pass, Tearney was
drawn in and the orange-and-black player simply
romped across the line for a touchdown.
From this Hawthorne’s right end kicked a goal
from a difficult angle and the score was tied.</p>

<p>Then, it seemed, that Hawthorne had found
herself. Success breeds success. The Orange-and-Black
took heart and after Crofton had
kicked off again Gould ran the ball back thirty
yards, eluding half the Crofton team, and
placed it on her enemy’s forty-five-yard line.
Crofton’s defense was now severely tested.
Gould gave the ball to his half-backs and his
full-back and twice Hawthorne made first down
by short line plunges. The vulnerable spot in
Crofton’s defense was at left tackle where
Parker, willing enough though he was, lacked
experience and weight. On her twenty-five-yard
line Crofton stiffened up and Gould tried a
forward pass that proved illegal. A plunge at
center gave the ball to Crofton, and Arnold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
punted on the first down. Gould caught the
ball and was promptly laid on his back by Gil.
A penalty for holding forced Hawthorne back
to her thirty yards. Gould tried an end run
that gained but seven yards and punted on the
next down. Crofton made three yards
through right tackle and then Arnold got off
a beautiful forward pass to Gil, and the latter,
by squirming and crowding, finally reached
Hawthorne’s twenty-yard line. Two rushes
failed to gain much distance and Arnold
dropped back to the thirty-yard line and, with
every watcher holding his breath, drop-kicked
the oval over the cross-bar. It was Crofton’s
turn to exult and exult she did, while from the
opposite side of the gridiron Hawthorne hurled
defiance. A moment later the first half ended,
the score 9 to 6; Crofton ahead by three points.</p>

<p>Jim returned to his party on the seats and
squeezed himself down beside Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just glorious?” cried Hope, her
cheeks crimson and her hair, loosened by the
breeze, fluttering about her face.</p>

<p>“Glorious!” laughed her brother. “It’s
jimmy!”</p>

<p>“Can we hold them, do you think?” asked
Jeffrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim shook his head. “I don’t know. I
heard Johnny tell Duncan Sargent a minute
ago that he’d give a hundred dollars if the
game were over. If Hawthorne pounded away
at the left side of our line she could gain like
anything. Parker’s doing the best he can but
he can’t stop them. How do you like the game,
Mr. Hanks?”</p>

<p>“Very much indeed. I—I find myself
quite excited. Hope has been instructing me in
the—er—fine points, but I fear she has found
me a very stupid pupil.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think I can give you more than
a C,” laughed Hope. “And mama gets a D
minus. Awhile ago she wanted to know why
the tall man in the white sweater didn’t play
harder!”</p>

<p>“Well, nobody told me he was the referee, or
whatever he is,” declared Mrs. Hazard. “For
my part I think I’d much prefer to be he.”</p>

<p>“Jim, I hope we just—just gobble them up
this half,” said Hope.</p>

<p>“Gobble them up,” repeated Mr. Hanks.
“Is that—er—a football term or do you use
the phrase metaphorically?”</p>

<p>“She means eat ’em alive, sir,” laughed Jeffrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t do that,” said Jim with a shake
of his head. “All we can hope to do is hold
them where they are. Isn’t Gil playing a peach
of a game? And Poke, too. Did you see him
go through for that touchdown? He was like
a human battering ram!”</p>

<p>“How’s Gary doing?” asked Jeffrey.</p>

<p>“Putting up a great game; playing a heap
better than Sargent, I think. But I suppose
that’s natural enough. Sargent’s captain and
that always puts a chap off his game, they say.
If I was that Hawthorne quarter I’d plug away
at Parker and Sargent, and I’ll bet I’d make
some bully gains.”</p>

<p>“They probably will this half,” said Jeffrey.
“Their coach has probably seen just what you
have. Somebody ought to tell Gould, too, that
he is punting too low. He doesn’t give his ends
a chance to get down the field. We’ve gained
every time on exchange of kicks.”</p>

<p>At that moment a voice cried, “Hazard!
Hazard! Is Hazard here?”</p>

<p>Jim jumped to his feet and answered. A
substitute player in a much begrimed uniform
ran up. “Johnny wants to see you at the
gym,” he called. “Come right up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the dickens does he want?” muttered
Jim. “Keep my seat for me, Jeff.”</p>

<p>He found Johnny in the midst of wild confusion.
Rubbers were busy with strains and
bruises, twenty fellows were talking at once.
The close air of the locker-room was heavy with
the fumes of alcohol and liniment. Johnny was
deep in conversation with captain and manager.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me?” asked Jim, pushing
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do! Look here, Hazard, where do
you stand?”</p>

<p>“Stand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Johnny impatiently. “Isn’t
there any way you can play this half?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered Jim. “Mr.
Gordon wired that I’d have to take an exam before
I could play.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t take it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. There wasn’t any way to take it
that I knew of.”</p>

<p>Johnny looked at Sargent questioningly.
“You wouldn’t risk it, would you?” he asked
in a low voice. Sargent shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’d be afraid to. J. G.’s a tartar about that
sort of thing. Better try Needham.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right.” Johnny nodded to Jim.
“Sorry. Thought maybe you could manage
somehow to help us out. Better not go against
faculty, though.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to risk it if you need me,” replied
Jim quietly.</p>

<p>“I won’t have it,” said Sargent decisively.
“You’d get fired as sure as fate, Hazard.
Much obliged, just the same.”</p>

<p>“Time’s up!” called Johnny.</p>

<p>Jim walked back to the field despondently.
If they had given him any encouragement, he
told himself, he’d have risked J. G.’s displeasure
and played. When he reached his seat
Jeffrey asked:</p>

<p>“What was it, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Johnny thought maybe I
could play in this half. They’re taking Parker
out. Needham’s going in. He will be twice as
bad as Parker, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Johnny know?”</p>

<p>“About me? I guess so. He seemed to
think I might have taken an exam somehow. I
didn’t see how I could have, do you?”</p>

<p>Jeffrey shook his head. “No, I don’t.”
Jim glanced along to find Mr. Hanks peering
interestedly through his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Do I understand, Jim,” he asked, “that
you could play if you passed an examination?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose so. That’s what Mr.
Gordon wired, you know.”</p>

<p>“Do they—er—need you, do you think?”</p>

<p>“They seem to think so,” answered Jim.
“They want a fellow to take Parker’s place.”</p>

<p>“Well—well—” Mr. Hanks’ eyes snapped
behind the thick lenses of his glasses—“do you
think you could pass an examination now?”</p>

<p>“Now!” exclaimed Jim. “Why—why—do
you mean—”</p>

<p>“I mean now!” repeated Mr. Hanks crisply.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll examine you, and if you pass—”</p>

and I’ll be ready to play in—” He stopped
and looked at Mr. Hanks.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes!” said the instructor.</p>

<p>Jeffrey seized his crutches and hobbled
quickly away, while Mr. Hanks and Jim left
their seats and disappeared behind the throng.
At that minute the Crofton team trotted back
on to the field and the cheering began again.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Instructed by its coach, Hawthorne began
to hammer the right side of Crofton’s
line at the start. Gould hurled his backs time
and again at Needham and at Captain Sargent.
Gain after gain was made, Needham proving no
harder to penetrate than Parker had been.
Sargent was a tougher proposition, but even he
was weakening. The first ten minutes of the
third quarter was a rout for Crofton. From
their forty yards to Crofton’s twenty-five the
Hawthorne players swept, and then, just when
success seemed within their grasp, a fumble
lost them the ball. Gil reeled off twelve yards
through the center of the Hawthorne line and
Smith and Benson plugged away for another
down. Then Hawthorne held stubbornly and
Arnold kicked. After that Hawthorne came
back again, slowly but surely, banging the right
guard and tackle positions for gain on gain,
and now and then sending Gould on an end run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
for the sake of variety. Both teams were tiring
now and the playing was slower. After a
particularly vicious plunge at his position Sargent
remained on the ground when the play was
over and it was a good three minutes before he
was on his feet again. Then Smith was hurt
and a substitute went in for him. With three
minutes of the third period remaining, the ball
was down on Crofton’s eighteen-yard line and
the Crimson-and-Gray was almost in her last
ditch. Had Gould chosen to try a goal from
field there he might have tied the score, but
the plucky little general was out for a victory
and insisted on a touchdown. He himself took
the ball for a plunge through left tackle and
got by for three yards. Then a delayed pass
went wrong and there was seven to gain on the
third down. There was a consultation and
Gould fell back as though he meant to kick. Instead
of that, however, he tried a short forward
pass that went to Gil instead of to one of his own
side and for the moment the advance was
stayed. On the second down Arnold punted to
midfield. For once Gould signaled a fair
catch. Again Hawthorne took up the attack,
but before she had made much headway the
whistle sounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>At that minute, over behind the row of Crofton
sympathizers, Mr. Hanks nodded his head
twice.</p>

<p>“You pass, Jim,” he said.</p>

<p>Johnny was looking anxiously about when
Jim leapt over the rope.</p>

<p>“All right!” he cried. “There are your
togs. Get into them.”</p>

<p>Jim, walled from gaze by a quickly formed
ring of substitutes, changed quicker than ever
he had in all his life. Out on the field the
whistle blew and the two lines formed again.
Finally Jim was ready and Johnny seized him
by the arm and led him along the side-line.</p>

<p>“Wait till this play is over,” he said.
“Then go in for Needham, and play low,
Hazard. Get the jump on those fellows and
break it up! Understand? <em>Break it up!</em> You
can do it; any one with an ounce of ginger can.
There you are! Scoot!”</p>

<p>And Jim scooted!</p>

<p>“Left tackle, sir!” he cried to the referee.
That official nodded. Needham, panting and
weak, yielded his headgear and walked off to receive
his meed of cheering. Arnold thumped
Jim on the back ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Oh, look who’s here!” he yelled shrilly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
“Well, well, well! Now let’s stop ’em,
Crofton!”</p>

<p>“Look out for the left half on a cross-buck,”
whispered Sargent from between swollen lips.
“And get low, Hazard. We’ve got to queer
this, you know, we’ve got to do it!”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Jim quietly, eyeing
his antagonist shrewdly. “Here’s where we
put ’em out of business.”</p>

<p>“Hello, son,” said the opposing tackle as the
lines set again. “How’d they let you in?
Watch out now, I’m coming through!”</p>

<p>But he didn’t. Jim beat him by a fraction of
a second and had his shoulder against his stomach
and was pushing him back before he knew
what had happened. Sargent, having no longer
to play two positions, braced wonderfully. In
three plays Hawthorne discovered that the left
of the opponent’s line was no longer a gateway.
Learning that fact cost her the possession of
the ball, for she missed her distance by a half-foot.
Crofton hurled Gil at left guard and
piled him through for four yards. Then came
a mix-up in the signals in which Smith’s substitute
hit Hawthorne’s line without the ball. Arnold
kicked, but his leg was getting tired and
Gould got the oval twenty yards down the field.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
On Crofton’s forty-yard mark Gould got off a
short forward pass that took the team over two
white lines. Then an end run netted nothing
and again Gould kicked. Benson got under the
ball, caught it, dropped it, tried to recover it
and was bowled aside by a Hawthorne forward
who snuggled the pigskin beneath him on
Crofton’s twelve-yard line. Two plunges netted
nothing and Gould fell back for a kick from
the twenty-eight-yard line. Although half the
Crofton team managed to break through and
though Gil absolutely tipped the ball with his
fingers, the oval flew fair and square across the
bar and Hawthorne had tied the score!</p>

<p>With four minutes to play the teams took
their places again. Sargent kicked off and Gil
and Tearney again downed Gould in his tracks.
A try at a forward pass failed and an on-side
kick went out at Crofton’s forty-five yards.
The ball was brought in and then Arnold
pegged at Hawthorne’s center for twenty yards.
A fumble by Gil was recovered by a Hawthorne
end and again the Orange-and-Black started for
the Crofton goal. But there was little time
left now and along the side-lines every one was
agreed that the contest would end in a tie.
But football is always uncertain. When two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
minutes remained and the ball was in Hawthorne’s
possession on her opponent’s thirty-eight
yards, after two exchange of punts, Gould
dashed off around Gil’s end of the line and with
good interference gained almost fifteen yards.
Hawthorne took heart at this and her cheers
boomed across the field. A plunge at right
tackle gave her five more. Then the unexpected
happened.</p>

<p>Gould dropped back into kicking position,
but when the ball went to him he poised it and
waited to find his end to make a forward pass.
Jim, hurling himself past his opponent, dodged
a half-back and before Gould could get the ball
away, was upon him. Down went the little
quarter and away bobbed the ball. An instant
of wild scrambling and then <a href="#i_frontis">Jim</a> was on his
feet again, the ball was scooped up into his arms
and he <a href="#i_frontis">was off with a clear field ahead</a>. After
him came the pursuit, foe and friend alike trailing
backward along the gridiron. Past the middle
of the field, and still well ahead, Jim dared
turn in toward the center of the middle of the
field. Then Gould, making what was his pluckiest
effort of all that long, hard-fought game, almost
reached him. But behind Gould was Gil,
and Gil it was who, just as the quarter-back’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
arms stretched out to bring Jim to earth, threw
himself in front of the enemy. Over they went
together, rolling and kicking, and Jim, with his
breath almost gone, staggered and fell across
the goal line.</p>

<p>What if Andy LaGrange, called on to kick
the goal in place of Sargent, did miss it by yards
and yards? The game was won! For another
year the Crimson-and-Gray held the championship!</p>

<p>Crofton was still shouting, still waving, still
cavorting when LaGrange missed that goal, and
still at it when, after two plays, the final whistle
sounded. Hope, standing on the seat,
flourished her flag wildly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it perfectly jimmy?” she cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks, beaming satisfiedly through his
spectacles, assented. “It is. We—er—as
you would say, ‘gobbled them up’!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we just? And didn’t Jim do beautifully,
Mr. Hanks?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hanks nodded slowly. “Yes,” he replied,
“your brother passed a very creditable,
if somewhat hurried examination.”</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
